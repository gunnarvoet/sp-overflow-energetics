Many of the python scripts in this repository have been converted from jupyter notebooks using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). They can be converted back to notebooks by running
```sh
jupytext --to notebook <notebook-name>.py
```
on the command line. The jupytext package is listed in [environment.yml](../environment.yml).
