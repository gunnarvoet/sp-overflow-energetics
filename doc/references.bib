  abstract = {A new, energetically, and dynamically consistent closure for the lee wave drag on the large-scale circulation is developed and tested in idealized and realistic ocean model simulations. The closure is based on the radiative transfer equation for internal gravity waves, integrated over wavenumber space, and consists of two lee wave energy compartments for up- and downward propagating waves, which can be cointegrated in an ocean model. Mean parameters for vertical propagation, mean\textendash flow interaction, and the vertical wave momentum flux are calculated assuming that the lee waves stay close to the spectral shape given by linear theory of their generation. Idealized model simulations demonstrate how lee waves are generated and interact with the mean flow and contribute to mixing, and document parameter sensitivities. A realistic eddy-permitting global model at 1/108 resolution coupled to the new closure yields a globally integrated energy flux of 0.27 TW into the lee wave field. The bottom lee wave stress on the mean flow can be locally as large as the surface wind stress and can reach into the surface layer. The interior energy transfers by the stress are directed from the mean flow to the waves, but this often reverses, for example, in the Southern Ocean in case of shear reversal close to the bottom. The global integral of the interior energy transfers from mean flow to waves is 0.14 TW, while 0.04 TW is driving the mean flow, but this share depends on parameter choices for nonlinear effects.},

  abstract = {When a slowly varying wavetrain of small amplitude propagates in a general medium, changes of frequency and wavenumber are determined along definite paths known as rays. It is shown that, for a wide class of conservative systems in fluid dynamics changes in ampli\-tude along the rays may be computed from conservation of wave action, which is defined as the wave energy divided by the intrinsic frequency. The intrinsic frequency is the frequency which would be measured by an observer moving with the local mean velocity of the medium. This result is the analogue for continuous systems of the adiabatic invariant for a classical simple harmonic oscillator. If the medium is time dependent or moving with a nonuniform mean velocity the intrinsic frequency is not normally constant, and wave energy is not conserved. Special cases include surface waves on a vertically uniform current in water of finite depth, internal gravity waves in a shear flow at large Richardson number, Alfv\`en waves, sound waves, and inertial waves in a homogeneous rotating liquid in geostrophic mean motion.},

  abstract = {We document the configuration and emergent simulation features from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) OM4.0 ocean/sea ice model. OM4 serves as the ocean/sea ice component for the GFDL climate and Earth system models. It is also used for climate science research and is contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. The ocean component of OM4 uses version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model and the sea ice component uses version 2 of the Sea Ice Simulator, which have identical horizontal grid layouts (Arakawa C-grid). We follow the Coordinated Ocean-sea ice Reference Experiments protocol to assess simulation quality across a broad suite of climate-relevant features. We present results from two versions differing by horizontal grid spacing and physical parameterizations: OM4p5 has nominal 0.5\textdegree{} spacing and includes mesoscale eddy parameterizations and OM4p25 has nominal 0.25\textdegree{} spacing with no mesoscale eddy parameterization. Modular Ocean Model version 6 makes use of a vertical Lagrangian-remap algorithm that enables general vertical coordinates. We show that use of a hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinate reduces the middepth ocean warming drift commonly found in pure z* vertical coordinate ocean models. To test the need for the mesoscale eddy parameterization used in OM4p5, we examine the results from a simulation that removes the eddy parameterization. The water mass structure and model drift are physically degraded relative to OM4p5, thus supporting the key role for a mesoscale closure at this resolution.},

NIWs appear nearly everywhere in the ocean as a spectral peak at and just above the local inertial period f, and the longest vertical wavelengths can propagate at least hundreds of kilometers toward the equator from their source regions; shorter vertical wavelengths do not travel as far and do not contain as much energy, but lead to turbulent mixing owing to their high shear. NIWs are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including the wind, nonlinear interactions with waves of other frequencies, lee waves over bottom topography, and geostrophic adjustment; the partition among these is not known, although the wind is likely the most important. NIWs likely interact strongly with mesoscale and submesoscale motions, in ways that are just beginning to be understood.},

With the Modular Microstructure Profiler, we gathered 519 profiles of potential temperature, salinity, potential density, pressure and kinetic energy dissipation rate.

  abstract = {We report direct, quantitative measurements of mixing associated with three cycles of a single, energetic, downward-propagating near-inertial wave in the Banda Sea at 6.5\textdegree S, l28\textdegree E during October 1998. The wave dominates the shear, containing 70\% of the total variance. Simultaneous depth/time series of shear, strain, Froude number (Fr), and microstructure allow direct computation of their coherence and phase from 50--120 m, for 14 days. In this depth range, 72\% of diapycnal diffusivity (68\% of dissipation) occurs in three distinct pulses, spaced at the inertial period of 4.4 days. These are collocated with maxima of transverse shear, strain and Fr. Inertial-band log diapycnal diffusivity, log10 Kp, is coherent at the 95\% confidence level with both components of shear and Froude number. In this data set, strain is more important than shear in modulating Fr. Owing to the low latitude, the inertial frequency (\{0 =114.4 cycles per day) is much smaller than the diurnal and tidal frequencies. Consequently, near-inertial motions may be studied separately from tides and other motions via time-domain filtering. Semiempirical WKB plane-wave solutions with observed frequency C00 = 1.02/o and vertical scale 100m explain 66\% and 42\% of inertial-band shear and strain variance, respectively. On the basis of the observed phase relationship between shear and strain, the wave is propagating equatorward, toward 295\textdegree{} true. Ratios of shear to strain and of parallel to transverse shear suggest that the wave's intrinsic frequency co1:::::::: 1.18/eff{$\cdot$} This indicates that background vorticity l; has lowered the effective Coriolis frequency, feff = fo + l;/2, relative to its planetary value, fo [Kunze, 1985]. Ray tracing suggests that the wave was generated near 6.9\textdegree S, 130.6\textdegree E, rv20 days prior to the cruise, coincident with the end of high winds associated with the SE monsoon. A slab mixed layer model [Pollard and Millard, 1970], forced with National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) model surface winds, confirms that fluxes from the wind to the ocean at this time were sufficient to generate the wave. A very simple model shows that mixing by monsoon-generated inertial waves may add an important and strongly time-dependent aspect to some regions' energy budgets.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study investigates the variability of water mass transformation (WMT) within the Weddell Gyre (WG). The WG serves as a pivotal site for the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and ocean ventilation because it is the primary origin of the largest volume of water mass in the global ocean, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Recent mooring data suggest substantial seasonal and interannual variability of AABW properties exiting the WG, and studies have linked the variability to the large-scale climate forcings affecting wind stress in the WG region. However, the specific thermodynamic mechanisms that link variability in surface forcings to variability in water mass transformations and AABW export remain unclear. This study explores WMT variability via WMT volume budgets derived from Walin's classic WMT framework, using three state-of-the-art, data-assimilating ocean reanalyses: Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean state estimate (ECCOv4), Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) and Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA). From the model outputs, we diagnose a closed form of the water mass budget for AABW that explicitly accounts for transport across the WG boundary, surface forcing, interior mixing, and numerical mixing. We examine the annual mean climatology of the WMT budget terms, the seasonal climatology, and finally the interannual variability. In ECCO and SOSE, we see strong interannual variability in AABW volume budget. In SOSE, we find an accelerating loss of AABW, driven largely by interior mixing and changes in surface salt fluxes. ECCO shows a similar trend during a 3-yr time period beyond what is covered in SOSE, but also reveals such trends to be part of interannual variability over a much longer time period. Overall, ECCO provides the most useful timeseries for understanding the processes and mechanisms that drive WMT and export variability. SODA, in contrast, displays unphysically large variability in AABW volume, which we attribute to its data assimilation scheme. We examine correlations between the WMT budgets and large-scale climate indices, including ENSO and SAM; no strong relationships emerge, suggesting that these reanalysis products may not reproduce the AABW export pathways and mechanisms hypothesized from observations.},

  abstract = {Observations of the flow of a two-layer fluid resulting from the motion of a towed streamlined two-dimensional obstacle are described in some detail. The experiments were designed to further our understanding of the factors governing the nature and magnitude of upstream disturbances in the general flow of stratified fluid over two-dimensional topography, and predictions for arbitrary two-dimensional flows are made from the results of these experiments. In particular, the relationship between uniformly stratified flow and single-layer flow over topography is suggested. Most of the observed features of interest in these experiments are nonlinear in character. Relatively complete descriptions of the observed flows are presented over a wide range of parameter values, and the phenomena observed include upstream undular and turbulent bores, bores with zero energy loss, `rarefactions' (in which the interface height changes monotonically over a transition region of continuously increasing length), and downstream hydraulic drops and jumps. Their properties are shown to be broadly consistent with predictions from a two-layer hydrostatic model based on continuity and momentum considerations, which employs jump criteria and rarefaction equations where appropriate. Bores occur because of nonlinear steepening when the layer containing the obstacle is thinner than the other, and rarefactions occur when this layer thickness is comparable with or greater than that of the other layer. The speed and amplitude of the upstream bores are governed by nonlinear effects, but their character is determined by a balance between nonlinear steepening, wave dispersion and interfacial friction when the bore is non-turbulent.             Experimental evidence is presented for two types of hysteresis or `multiple equilibria' - situations where two different flow states may exist for the same external steady conditions. In the first of these hysteresis types, the upstream flow may be supercritical or consist of an upstream bore state. It is analogous to the type anticipated for single-layer flow by Baines \& Davies (1980) and described numerically by Pratt (1983), but it is only found experimentally for part of the expected parameter range, apparently because of interfacial stress effects. The second hysteresis type is new, and involves the presence or absence of a downstream hydraulic drop and following jump.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the effect of continuous convection from small sources of buoyancy on the properties of the environment when the region of interest is bounded. The main assumptions are that the entrainment into the turbulent buoyant region is at a rate proportional to the local mean upward velocity, and that the buoyant elements spread out at the top of the region and become part of the non-turbulent environment at that level. Asymptotic solutions, valid at large times, are obtained for the cases of plumes from point and line sources and also periodically released thermals. These all have the properties that the environment is stably stratified, with the density profile fixed in shape, changing at a uniform rate in time at all levels, and everywhere descending (with ascending buoyant elements).             The analysis is carried out in detail for the point source in an environment of constant cross-section. Laboratory experiments have been conducted for this case, and these verify the major predictions of the theory. It is then shown how the method can be extended to include more realistic starting conditions for the convection, and a general shape of bounded environment. Finally, the model is applied quantitatively to a variety of problems in engineering, the atmosphere and the ocean, and the limitations on its use are discussed.},

Inviscid linear theory is generally used to predict the generation rate of lee waves, but the location and mechanism of wave breaking leading to eventual dissipation of energy and irreversible mixing are poorly constrained. In this study, a linear model with viscosity, diffusivity and an upper boundary is used to demonstrate the potential importance of the surface in reflecting lee wave energy back into the interior, making the case for treating lee waves as a full water-column process. In the absence of critical levels, it is shown that lee waves can be expected to interact with the upper ocean, resulting in enhanced vertical velocities and dissipation and mixing near the surface. The impact of the typical oceanic conditions of increasing background velocity and stratification with height above bottom are investigated and shown to contribute to enhanced upper ocean vertical velocities and mixing.},

By carefully modifying the forcing fields we show that solutions where internal waves are forced have {$\sim$} less mesoscale KE compared with solutions where they are not. We apply a coarse-graining method to quantify the KE fluxes across time scales and demonstrate that the decrease in mesoscale KE is associated with an internal wave-induced reduction of the inverse energy cascade and an enhancement of the forward energy cascade from sub-to super-inertial frequencies. The integrated KE forward transfer rate in the upper ocean is equivalent to half and a quarter of the regionally averaged near-inertial wind work in winter and summer, respectively, with the strongest fluxes localized at surface submesoscale fronts and filaments.},

  abstract = {Ocean vortices are an important regional agent of water transport and cross-frontal exchange. This study is a first attempt to compare statistics of 3D properties of mesoscale eddies over the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. Results suggest that eddies in the central Greenland Sea are less intense, have smaller vertical extent and much smaller heat anomalies in their cores compared to eddies in the Lofoten Basin of the Norwegian Sea. In addition, these results suggest a relatively small inter-basin eddy exchange. The large-scale pattern of eddy translations shows that eddies cyclonically skirt the Norwegian-Greenland region. There is also a regional cyclonic pattern in the Lofoten Basin with a consistent signature of eddy merger in the northern part of the basin. We confirm that eddies generated from the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current (NwASC) have a significant effect on the amount of heat the NwASC brings to the Arctic. The heat lost from the NwASC between the Svinoy and Sorkapp sections associated with the westward eddy heat transport translates to 70{$\pm$}23 TW, 90\% of which occurs in the Lofoten Basin. This accounts to 35\% of the heat advected by the NwASC across the Svinoy section and is comparable with the heat loss in the Barents Sea. Interannual variability of the heat flux due to a change in the number of generated eddies is relatively small ({$\sim$}10 TW). Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that, by varying temperature of their cores, the generated eddies can effectively damp temperature anomalies that propagate north along the NwASC.},

These overflows, along with entrained Atlantic waters, form a major portion of the North Atlantic Deep Water, which pervades the abyssal ocean. Three years of Seaglider observations of the overflows across the eastern Greenland\textendash Scotland Ridge are leveraged to map the distribution of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy on the Iceland\textendash Faroe Ridge. A method has been applied using the finescale vertical velocity and density measurements from the glider to infer dissipation. The method, termed the large-eddy method (LEM), is compared with a microstructure survey of the Faroe Bank Channel (FBC). The LEM reproduces the patterns of dissipation observed in the microstructure survey, which vary over several orders of magnitude. Agreement between the inferred LEM and more direct microstructure measurements is within a factor of 2. Application to the 9432 dives that encountered overflow waters on the Iceland\textendash Faroe Ridge reveals three regions of enhanced dissipation: one downstream of the primary FBC sill, another downstream of the secondary FBC sill, and a final region in a narrow jet of overflow along the Iceland shelf break.},

In the framework of linear quasigeostrophic flow, the best fitted vertical trapping depths range from 8 to 15 km in the absence of steep topography, but one mooring near an isolated seamount exhibited vertical trapping that was more pronounced and energetic with a vertical trapping depth of 5 km. The ratios of current speeds and geostrophic pressure streamfunctions at the sea surface compared to the bottom are 88\% in the absence of steep topography, 63\% near an isolated seamount, and overall on average 83\% of their value at a reference depth of 5300 m. It is hypothesized that weakly depth-dependent eddies impinging upon topographic features introduce to the flow the horizontal length scales of the topography, and these smaller lateral scales are subject to bottom intensification.},

Here, we show that deep oceanic heat uptake is a major source of spread in simulations of 21st century climate change. Models with deeper baseline polar mixed layers are associated with larger deep ocean warming and smaller global surface warming. Based on this result, we set forth an observational constraint on polar vertical oceanic mixing. This constraint suggests that many models may overestimate the efficiency of polar oceanic mixing and therefore may underestimate future surface warming. Thus to reduce climate change uncertainties at time-scales relevant for policy-making, improved understanding and modelling of oceanic mixing at high latitudes is crucial.},

This survey covered a half million square miles of Slope, Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea Waters in the western North Atlantic. Quantities plotted as a function of density are acceleration potential, potential temperature, desso1ved oxygen and potential vorticity. The transition from Sargasso Sea Water to Slope Water in the upper thermocline ({$\sigma$}0{$<$}27.1) is sharp and coincides closely with the dynamical boundary of the Gulf Stream, defined by the gradient of acceleration potential. This indicates that water mass exchanges across the Gulf Stream-Slope Water front are limited at these levels. Below the 27.1 {$\Sigma$}0 surface, the gradient of acceleration potential still reveals the position of the Stream, but there is no coincident water man boundary. This and the uniformity of potential vorticity across the Stream suggest that the deep property fields are being efficiently homogenized by mesoscale exchanges across the Gulf Stream. A cross-frontal eddy diffusivity of KH=2.5\texttimes 106 cm2 s-1 estimated from oxygen flux calculations agrees well with previously published values for frontal regimes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mesoscale eddies are universal features of the ocean circulation, yet the processes by which their energy is dissipated remain poorly understood. One hypothesis argues that the interaction of strong geostrophic flows with rough bottom topography effects an energy transfer between eddies and internal waves, with the breaking of these waves causing locally elevated dissipation focused near the sea floor. This study uses hydrographic and velocity data from a 1-yr mooring cluster deployment in the Southern Ocean to test this hypothesis. The moorings were located over a small (\textasciitilde 10 km) topographic obstacle to the east of Drake Passage in a region of high eddy kinetic energy, and one was equipped with an ADCP at 2800-m depth from which internal wave shear variance and dissipation rates were calculated. Examination of the ADCP time series revealed a predominance of upward-propagating internal wave energy and a significant correlation (r = 0.45) between shear variance levels and subinertial near-bottom current speeds. Periods of strong near-bottom flow coincided with increased convergence of eddy-induced interfacial form stress in the bottom 1500 m. Predictions of internal wave energy radiation were made from theory using measured near-bottom current speeds, and the mean value of wave radiation (5.3 mW m-2) was sufficient to support the dissipated power calculated from the ADCP. A significant temporal correlation was also observed between radiated and dissipated power. Given the ubiquity of strong eddy flows and rough topography in the Southern Ocean, the transfer from eddy to internal wave energy is likely to be an important term in closing the ocean energy budget.},

It is shown that a wave group moves with the local group velocity defined in terms of the dominant wavenumber, the absolute frequency and horizontal components of wavenumber being constant. The wave energy carried by a wave packet varies, being proportional to the frequency relative to a frame moving with the local mean wind. A wave packet, on this approximation, can never pass through a critical level at which its horizontal phase velocity is equal to the mean wind, nor is it reflected there. These results imply restrictions on the propagation of internal gravity waves from the troposphere to the upper atmosphere.},

  abstract = {For small-scale turbulence to achieve water mass transformation and thus affect the large-scale overturning circulation, it must occur in stratified water. Observations show that abyssal turbulence is strongly enhanced in the bottom few hundred meters in regions with rough topography, and it is thought that these abyssal mixing layers are crucial for closing and shaping the overturning circulation. If it were left unopposed, however, bottom-intensified turbulence would mix away the observed mixing-layer stratification over the course of a few years. It is proposed here that the homogenizing tendency of mixing may be balanced by baroclinic restratification. It is shown that bottom-intensified mixing, if it occurs on a large-scale topographic slope such as a midocean ridge flank, not only erodes stratification but also tilts isopycnals in the bottom few hundred meters. This tilting of isopycnals generates a reservoir of potential energy that can be tapped into by submesoscale baroclinic eddies. The eddies slide dense water under light water and thus restratify the mixing layer, similar to what happens in the surface mixed layer. This restratification is shown to be effective enough to balance the homogenizing tendency of mixing and to maintain the observed mixing-layer stratification. This suggests that submesoscale baroclinic eddies may play a crucial role in providing the stratification mixing can act on, thus allowing sustained water mass transformation. Through their restratification of abyssal mixing layers, submesoscale eddies may therefore directly affect the strength and structure of the abyssal overturning circulation.},

The transition is mainly explained by the emergence of ubiquitous submesoscale density fronts and ageostrophic circulations about them in the weakly stratified surface boundary layer. Here the highresolution simulations are further analyzed from the perspective of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum shape and spectral energy fluxes in the mesoscale-to-submesoscale range in the upper ocean. For wavenumbers greater than the mesoscale energy peak, there is a submesoscale power-law regime in the spectrum with an exponent close to Ϫ2. In the KE balance an important conversion from potential to kinetic energy takes place at all wavenumbers in both mesoscale and submesoscale ranges; this conversion is the energetic counterpart of the vertical restratification flux and frontogenesis discussed in the earlier papers. A significant forward cascade of KE occurs in the submesoscale range en route to dissipation at even smaller scales. This is contrary to the inverse energy cascade of geostrophic turbulence and it is, in fact, fundamentally associated with the horizontally divergent (i.e., ageostrophic) velocity component. The submesoscale dynamical processes of frontogenesis, frontal instability, and breakdown of diagnostic force balance are all essential elements of the energy cycle of potential energy conversion and forward KE cascade.},

The ϳ400-m-high seamount is on the southern edge of the ridge (centered at 21\textdegree 43\cyrchar\CYRJE 49\cyrchar\CYRLJE N, 158\textdegree 38\cyrchar\CYRJE 48\cyrchar\CYRLJE W), 42 km northwest of Oahu. A 1-km-resolution numerical simulation shows that the flow within the depth range of the seamount tends to be accelerated around the seamount rather than going up and over it. The flow patterns, however, are more complicated than for an isolated seamount because of the influence of the ϳ3000-m-high Kaena Ridge. Comparison with the numerical simulations indicates that the across-ridge asymmetry, in which dissipation on the north-northeastern side of the seamount was higher and more concentrated toward the bed than on the south-southwestern side, is consistent with an M2 tidal beam generated at the northern edge of the ridge. The along-ridge asymmetry, with higher dissipation on the east-southeastern flank than on the west-northwestern flank, is in qualitative agreement with M2 shear variance from the model simulation. The average observed dissipation rate over the seamount was ␧ ϭ 6.2 ϫ 10Ϫ8 W kgϪ1, and diapycnal diffusivity was K␳ ϭ 1.3 ϫ 10Ϫ3 m2 sϪ1. Dissipation measurements following the 1000-m isobath south-southwest of the seamount suggest along-ridge internal tide generation caused by topographic steering that creates an along-ridge current over critical topography northwest of the seamount.},

  abstract = {Dense overflows entrain surrounding waters at specific locations, for example, sills and constrictions, but also along the descent over the continental slope. The amount of entrainment dictates the final properties of these overflows, and thus is of fundamental importance to the understanding of the formation of deep water masses. Even when resolving the overflows, coarse resolution global circulation and climate models cannot resolve the entrainment processes that are often parameterized. A new empirical parameterization is suggested, obtained using an oceanic and laboratory dataset, which includes two novel aspects. First, the parameterization depends on both the Froude number (Fr) and Reynolds number of the flow. Second, it takes into account subcritical (Fr , 1) entrainment. A weak, but nonzero, entrainment can change the final density and, consequently, the depth and location of important water masses in the open ocean. This is especially true when the dense current follows a long path over the slope in a subcritical regime, as observed in the southern Greenland Deep Western Boundary Current. A streamtube model employing this new parameterization gives results that are more consistent with previous laboratory and oceanographic observations than when a classical parameterization is used. Finally, the new parameterization predictions compare favorably to recent oceanographic measurements of entrainment and turbulent diapycnal mixing rates, using scaling arguments to relate the entrainment ratio to diapycnal diffusivities.},

The phasing of turbulence, the onset and breakdown of convective overturns, and the pathway to irreversible mixing are quantified. Mixing efficiency shows a systematic dependence on tidal phase, and during the breakdown of large convective overturns it is approximately 0.6, a value that is substantially larger than the commonly assumed value of 0.2 used for calculating scalar mixing from the turbulent dissipation rate. Diapycnal diffusivity is calculated using the irreversible diapycnal flux and, for tall overturns of O(50) m, the diffusivity is found to be almost 1000 times higher than the molecular diffusivity. The Thorpe (overturn) length scale is often used as a proxy for the Ozmidov length scale and thus infers the turbulent dissipation rate from overturns. The accuracy of overturn-based estimates of the dissipation rate is assessed for this flow. The Ozmidov length scale LO and Thorpe length scale LT are found to behave differently during a tidal cycle: LT decreases during the convective instability, while LO increases; there is a significant phase lag between the maxima of LT and LO; and finally LT is not linearly related to LO. Thus, the Thorpe-inferred dissipation rates are quite different from the actual values. Interestingly, the ratio of their cycle-averaged values is found to be O(1), a result explained on the basis of available potential energy.},

  abstract = {A new assessment of how much heat Earth has accumulated since 1960 is made by examining ocean heat content changes.           ,              Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) drives the ongoing global warming and can best be assessed across the historical record (that is, since 1960) from ocean heat content (OHC) changes. An accurate assessment of OHC is a challenge, mainly because of insufficient and irregular data coverage. We provide updated OHC estimates with the goal of minimizing associated sampling error. We performed a subsample test, in which subsets of data during the data-rich Argo era are colocated with locations of earlier ocean observations, to quantify this error. Our results provide a new OHC estimate with an unbiased mean sampling error and with variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales (signal) that can be reliably distinguished from sampling error (noise) with signal-to-noise ratios higher than 3. The inferred integrated EEI is greater than that reported in previous assessments and is consistent with a reconstruction of the radiative imbalance at the top of atmosphere starting in 1985. We found that changes in OHC are relatively small before about 1980; since then, OHC has increased fairly steadily and, since 1990, has increasingly involved deeper layers of the ocean. In addition, OHC changes in six major oceans are reliable on decadal time scales. All ocean basins examined have experienced significant warming since 1998, with the greatest warming in the southern oceans, the tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean, and the tropical/subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This new look at OHC and EEI changes over time provides greater confidence than previously possible, and the data sets produced are a valuable resource for further study.},

  abstract = {Observational records of ocean heat content show that ocean warming is accelerating           ,                             Climate change from human activities mainly results from the energy imbalance in Earth's climate system caused by rising concentrations of heat-trapping gases. About 93\% of the energy imbalance accumulates in the ocean as increased ocean heat content (OHC). The ocean record of this imbalance is much less affected by internal variability and is thus better suited for detecting and attributing human influences (               1               ) than more commonly used surface temperature records. Recent observation-based estimates show rapid warming of Earth's oceans over the past few decades (see the figure) (               1               ,               2               ). This warming has contributed to increases in rainfall intensity, rising sea levels, the destruction of coral reefs, declining ocean oxygen levels, and declines in ice sheets; glaciers; and ice caps in the polar regions (               3               ,               4               ). Recent estimates of observed warming resemble those seen in models, indicating that models reliably project changes in OHC.},

One sensing resource that provides observational access to the seafloor environment are existing networks of ocean bottom fiber optic cables; these cables, coupled to modern distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems, can provide dense arrays of broadband seismic observations capable of recording both seismic events and the ambient noise wavefield. Here, we report a marine DAS application which demonstrates the strength and limitation of this new technique on submarine structural characterization. Based on ambient noise DAS records on a 20 km section of a fiber optic cable offshore of Moss Landing, CA, in Monterey Bay, we extract Scholte waves from DAS ambient noise records using interferometry techniques and invert the resulting multimodal dispersion curves to recover a high resolution 2D shear-wave velocity image of the near seafloor sediments. We show for the first time that the migration of coherently scattered Scholte waves observed on DAS records can provide an approach for resolving sharp lateral contrasts in subsurface properties, particularly shallow faults and depositional features near the seafloor. Our results provide improved constraints on shallow submarine features in Monterey Bay, including fault zones and paleo-channel deposits, thus highlighting one of many possible geophysical uses of the marine cable network.},

Here we synthesize insights gained into overturning flows, interocean exchanges, and water mass distributions and pathways in the South Atlantic. The overturning circulation in the South Atlantic uniquely carries heat equatorward and exports freshwater poleward and consists of~two strong overturning cells. Density and pressure gradients, winds, eddies, boundary currents, and interocean exchanges create an energetic circulation in the subtropical and tropical South Atlantic Ocean. The relative importance of these drivers varies with the observed latitude and time scale. AMOC, interocean exchanges, and climate changes drive ocean warming at all depths, upper ocean salinification, and freshening in the deep and abyssal ocean in the South Atlantic. Long-term sustained observations are critical to detect and understand these changes and their impacts.},

  abstract = {The role of baroclinicity in the dynamics of abyssal equator-crossing flows is examined by studying two-layer models of the flow valid in the equatorial region. Three new analytical models are derived from two-layer shallow-water theory. One of these models (Equatorial Model I, or EMI) reduces to the Swaters and Flierl coupled model in the midlatitude limit. In the equatorial limit, the lower-layer dynamics of EMI are that of the complete shallow-water equations, and the upper-layer dynamics are built upon quasigeostrophic potential vorticity conservation with a balance equation to relate the streamfunction and pressure. Simple numerical simulations are performed using this model to investigate its behavior in certain idealized situations, including equatorcrossing lenses and currents. In the midlatitudes, the dynamics of EMI are characterized by strong baroclinic interactions between the layers, while near the equator all three models exhibit a partial decoupling of the layers. This motivates the use of a one-layer reduced-gravity model to simulate abyssal dynamics in the immediate vicinity of the equator. Such simulations are reported elsewhere. A uniformly valid metamodel is derived that contains all of the necessary terms so that it may reduce, in the appropriate parameter limit, to any of the three models derived here.},

The rate of time-dependent climate change is determined both by the strength of atmosphere\textendash surface climate feedbacks and by the strength of processes that remove heat from the surface to the deep ocean. Here a first small ensemble of coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean climate model experiments in which the parameters that control three key ocean physical processes are perturbed is described. It is found that the perturbations have little impact on the rate of ocean heat uptake, and thus have little impact on the time-dependent rate of global warming. Under the idealized scenario of 1\% yr-1 compounded CO2 increase, the spread in the transient climate response is of the order of a few tenths of a degree, in contrast to the spread of order of 1\textdegree{} caused by perturbing atmospheric model parameters.},

The two constituent parts of the decomposition are positive definite and therefore meaningful representations of available energy. The first (inner) part accounts for available potential energy that is intrinsic to each control volume, while the second (outer) part accounts for the context provided by the larger parent volume to which each smaller control volume belongs. While the intended application casts the control volumes as connected rooms in a building, the formulation can be applied to any domain that is partitioned by either physical boundaries or abstract zones and can be invoked recursively to clarify the hierarchical dependence of available potential energy on scale and context. By deriving budgets for the decomposition, two ways in which available potential energy can be redistributed between its inner and outer parts are identified. The first accounts for an apparent generation of available potential energy due to diapycnal mixing within a control volume that is constrained by removable boundaries. The second involves the reversible conversion between inner and outer parts that occurs when mass or heat is transported between control volumes and accounts for the concomitant change in context. Analytical expressions are derived for the hierarchy of contributions to available potential energy in an example involving three connected spaces, before budgets for the decomposition from a direct numerical simulation are analysed. Finally, the dependence of mixing efficiency on remote regions that was identified by Davies Wykes               et al.               (               J.

  abstract = {Abstract                            The physical mechanisms that remove energy from the Southern Ocean's vigorous mesoscale eddy field are not well understood. One proposed mechanism is direct energy transfer to the internal wave field in the ocean interior, via eddy-induced straining and shearing of preexisting internal waves. The magnitude, vertical structure, and temporal variability of the rate of energy transfer between eddies and internal waves is quantified from a 14-month deployment of a mooring cluster in the Scotia Sea. Velocity and buoyancy observations are decomposed into wave and eddy components, and the energy transfer is estimated using the Reynolds-averaged energy equation. We find that eddies gain energy from the internal wave field at a rate of -2.2 {$\pm$} 0.6 mW m               -2               , integrated from the bottom to 566 m below the surface. This result can be decomposed into a positive (eddy to wave) component, equal to 0.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 mW m               -2               , driven by horizontal straining of internal waves, and a negative (wave to eddy) component, equal to -2.5 {$\pm$} 0.6 mW m               -2               , driven by vertical shearing of the wave spectrum. Temporal variability of the transfer rate is much greater than the mean value. Close to topography, large energy transfers are associated with low-frequency buoyancy fluxes, the underpinning physics of which do not conform to linear wave dynamics and are thereby in need of further research. Our work suggests that eddy\textendash internal wave interactions may play a significant role in the energy balance of the Southern Ocean mesoscale eddy and internal wave fields.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of Antarctic Bottom Water is produced in the Weddell Sea, through mixing between the cold and dense shelf water masses and the warm and saline off-shelf water. We present observations of the dense Filchner overflow plume from one mooring at the Filchner sill and two moorings located downstream, on the continental slope. The plume variability over the continental slope at a monthly time scale is related to upstream conditions at the Filchner sill, with a high correlation in density. Revised column-integrated volume transport calculations across the Filchner sill indicate 50\% higher values in 2010 compared with the earlier estimates available from 1985. Over the continental slope, the plume thickness fluctuates strongly between less than 25 m and more than 250 m. Observations of elevated temperature variance and high Froude numbers at the plume interface imply high mixing rates and entrainment of ambient water masses. The mixing events typically coincide with shear spikes across the plume. The shear spikes appear quasi-periodically, when counterrotating oscillations with periods of 24 and 72 h align. The clockwise 24-h oscillation is related to diurnal, barotropic tidal currents and topographic vorticity waves, whereas the counterclockwise 72-h oscillation is related to vortex stretching or topographic vorticity waves.},

  abstract = {Under certain tidal conditions, a saline underflow originating in the Pacific Ocean moves into Lake Ogawara, Japan. The underflow consists of a uniform saline bottom layer that is slightly warmer than the ambient and an interfacial shear layer in which the velocity and density are decreased. Within the experimental area the underflow is confined to a channel approximately 1 km wide and is essentially two-dimensional. The underflow had a bulk Richardson number, defined in terms of the mean properties, between 1 and 2. The rate of entrainment into the bottom layer was calculated using two distinct methods. The first method used the change in the maximum salinity of the underflow measured at two stations along the path of the underflow to infer the amount of ambient water entrained. The second method made direct measurements of vertical mass fluxes with a profiler. The agreement between the two methods was excellent. The measured entrainment coefficients were consistent with the derived entrainment law. The turbulent structure of the flow was mapped for a 3 h quasisteady period of the flow. Turbulence is predominantly generated on the bottom boundary and is transported vertically to the density interface, where it leads to mixing.},

Here, topographically steered flows are investigated experimentally, as laminar, dense gravity currents are observed to impinge on and flow along sloping, V-shaped canyons and ridges. Ridges, as well as canyons, were observed to steer the dense water downslope. A dynamical regime, in which the along-slope transport is balanced by a return flow in the Ekman layer to maintain a geostrophically balanced downslope flow along the corrugation, has been proposed. Results from a previously published analytical model describing such flows are compared with the laboratory experiments. The response of the flow to variations in four governing parameters (slope, rotation, volume flux and reduced gravity) is generally described well by the model and results agree qualitatively, although theory slightly underestimates the dense layer thickness. Vertical velocity profiles resolving the Ekman spiral were obtained using a laser Doppler velocimeter and they showed the secondary, transverse circulation superimposed on the primary, downslope flow. A particle flowing down the canyon/along the ridge can be expected to follow a helix-like path, and dye released within the dense layer showed this. The experiments support the analytical model and the dynamical regime proposed for topographically steered flows. The gravity current split in two when the transport capacity of the corrugation was exceeded; one part continued along the slope and the other flowed downslope along the corrugation.},

The overflow region is characterized by high mesoscale variability and energetic oscillations, accompanied by a high degree of sea surface level variability. Here, 2-month-long time series of velocity and temperature from 12 moorings deployed in May 2008 are analyzed to describe the oscillations and explore their generation and propagation. The observed 2.5\textendash 5-day oscillations in velocity and temperature are highly coherent both horizontally and vertically, and they are associated with 100\textendash 200-m-thick boluses of cold plume water flowing along the slope. A positive correlation between temperature and relative vorticity and the distribution of clockwise/counterclockwise rotation across the slope suggest a train of alternating warm cyclonic and cold anticyclonic eddies, where the maximum plume thickness is located downslope of the eddy center. The along-slope phase velocity is found to be 25\textendash 60 cm s21, corresponding to a wavelength of 75\textendash 180 km, while the vertical phase propagation is downward. The oscillations are present already in the sill region.

  abstract = {AbstractIn studies of ocean mixing, it is generally assumed that small-scale turbulent overturns lose 15-20  \% of their energy in eroding the background stratification. Accumulating evidence that this energy fraction, or mixing efficiency Rf, significantly varies depending on flow properties challenges this assumption, however. Here, we examine the implications of a varying mixing efficiency for ocean energetics and deep water mass transformation. Combining current parameterizations of internal wave-driven mixing with a recent model expressing Rf as a function of a turbulence intensity parameter Reb = {$\epsilon$}?/?N2, we show that accounting for reduced mixing efficiencies in regions of weak stratification or energetic turbulence (high Reb) strongly limits the ability of breaking internal waves to supply oceanic potential energy and drive abyssal upwelling. Moving from a fixed Rf = 1/6 to a variable efficiency Rf(Reb) causes Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling induced by locally-dissipating internal tides and lee waves to fall from 9 to 4 Sv, and the corresponding potential energy source to plunge from 97 to 44 GW. When adding the contribution of remotely-dissipating internal tides under idealized distributions of energy dissipation, the total rate of Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling is reduced by about a factor of 2, reaching 5-15 Sv compared to 10-33 Sv for a fixed efficiency. Our results suggest that distributed mixing, overflow-related boundary processes and geothermal heating are more effective in consuming abyssal waters than topographically-enhanced mixing by breaking internal waves. Our calculations also point to the importance of accurately constraining Rf(Reb) and including the effect in ocean models.},

  author = {Dell, Rebecca Walsh},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {This paper begins to explore a previously neglected mechanism for abyssal ocean mixing using bottom boundary layer dynamics. Abyssal mixing and the associated upward buoyancy fluxes are necessary to balance the sinking of dense waters at high latitudes and to close the global overturning circulation. Previous studies have concentrated on the hypothesis that the primary mechanism for this mixing is breaking internal waves generated by tidal flows over rough topography. However, intriguing observations, particularly from the Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment, suggest that mixing in the flank canyons of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge generated when strong mean flows interact with the many sills and constrictions within the canyons may represent a dynamically important amount of abyssal mixing. The energy pathways and mechanisms of this mixing are much less clear than in the case of breaking internal waves. This study attempts to clarify this by suggesting an analogy with an idealized diffusive boundary layer over a sloping bottom. This boundary layer is characterized by up-slope flows powered by the buoyancy flux in the fluid far from the boundary. Here we explore the energy budget of the boundary layer, and find that the diffusive boundary layer provides flows that are generally consistent with those observed in submarine canyons. In addition, we derive the vertical velocity in the far-field fluid, analogous to an Ekman pumping velocity, that these boundary layers can induce when the bottom slope is not constant. Finally, we present both theoretical and numerical models of exchange flows between the bottom boundary and the far-field flow when the bottom slope is not constant. These exchange flows provide a mechanism by which boundary-driven mixing can affect the overall stratification and buoyancy fluxes of the basin interior.},

Summing the mean barotropic transport with the mean baroclinic transport relative to zero at the seafloor of 127.7 Sv gives a total transport through Drake Passage of 173.3 Sv.

  doi = {10.1575/1912/27424},
  abstract = {An emerging paradigm posits that the abyssal overturning circulation is driven by bottom-enhanced mixing, which results in vigorous upwelling in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) along the sloping seafloor and downwelling in the stratified mixing layer (SML) above; their residual is the overturning circulation. This boundary-controlled circulation fundamentally alters abyssal tracer distributions, with implications for global climate. Chapter 1 describes how a basin-scale overturning circulation arises from the coupling between the ocean interior and mixing-driven boundary layers over rough topography, such as the sloping flanks of mid-ocean ridges. BBL upwelling is well predicted by boundary layer theory, whereas the compensation by SML downwelling is weakened by the upward increase of the basin-wide stratification, which supports a finite net overturning. These simulated watermass transformations are comparable to best-estimate diagnostics but are sustained by a crude parameterization of boundary layer restratification processes. In Chapter 2, I run a realistic simulation of a fracture zone canyon in the Brazil Basin to decipher the non-linear dynamics of abyssal mixing layers and their interactions with rough topography. Using a hierarchy of progressively idealized simulations, I identify three physical processes that set the stratification of abyssal mixing layers (in addition to the weak buoyancy-driven cross-slope circulation): submesoscale baroclinic eddies on the ridge flanks, enhanced up-canyon flow due to inhibition of the cross-canyon thermal wind, and homogenization of canyon troughs below the level of blocking sills. Combined, these processes maintain a sufficiently large near-boundary stratification for mixing to drive globally significant BBL upwelling. In Chapter 3, simulated Tracer Release Experiments illustrate how passive tracers are mixed, stirred, and advected in abyssal mixing layers. Exact diagnostics reveal that while a tracer's diapycnal motion is directly proportional to the mean divergence of mixing rates, its diapycnal spreading depends on both the mean mixing rate and an additional non-linear stretching term. These simulations suggest that the theorized boundary-layer control on the abyssal circulation is falsifiable: downwelling in the SML has already been confirmed by the Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment, while an upcoming experiment in the Rockall Trough will confirm or deny the existence of upwelling in the BBL.},

Each section, made perpendicular to the plume direction, comprised 10\textendash 14 stations measuring the outflow properties and velocity. The overflow defined as water with potential temperatures below 3 \textdegree C has densities greater than 28.1 kg m\textendash 3, salinities between 34.9 and 35.1, with velocities as high as 80 cm s\textendash 1 approximately 20 km downstream from the sill. We use these measurements to describe the characteristics of the outflow and to estimate the amount of friction and mixing as the plume travels along the continental slope into the Iceland Basin. From Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) measurements we estimate stress in the bottom Ekman layer. Our stress results are best related to the overflow velocity with a drag coefficient of 0.5 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 3 and to the height of the bottom Ekman layer with a von Karman constant of 0.75. Below a potential temperature of 8 \textdegree C, the isotherms sink with distance downstream. Calculating transport below different isotherms, we make an estimate for the amount of entrainment. In the region downstream of the sill, entrainment is initially maximum near the 0 \textdegree C isotherm just above the cold dense outflow and turbulent diffusivities reach as high as 500 cm2 s\textendash 1. Fifty kilometre downstream of the sill the depth of maximum entrainment has moved upwards to the 2 \textdegree C isotherm and turbulent diffusivity has decreased to 50 cm2 s\textendash 1. Froude numbers are found to exceed one in the centre of the overflow on all three sections. Calculating Richardson numbers we see evidence that mixing takes place above the fast flowing outflow core.},

Since 1971, it has been responsible for storing more than 90\% of the excess heat added to the Earth system by anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions. Adding this heat to the ocean contributes substantially to sea level rise and affects vital marine ecosystems. Considering the global ocean's large role in ongoing climate variability and change, it is a good place to focus in order to understand what observed changes have occurred to date and, by using models, what future changes might arise under continued anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. While sparse measurement coverage leads to enhanced uncertainties with long-term historical estimates of change, modern measurements are beginning to provide the clearest picture yet of ongoing global ocean change. Observations show that the ocean is warming from the near-surface through to the abyss, a conclusion that is strengthened with each new analysis. In this assessment, we revisit observation- and model-based estimates of ocean warming from the industrial era to the present and show a consistent, full-depth pattern of change over the observed record that is likely to continue at an ever-increasing pace if effective actions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are not taken.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerical simulations are examined in order to determine the local mean flow response to the generation, propagation, and breakdown of two-dimensional mountain waves. Realistic and idealized cases are considered, and in all instances the pressure drag exerted by flow across an O(40 km) wide mountain fails to produced a significant net mean flow deceleration in the O(400 km) region surrounding the mountain. The loss of momentum in the local patches of decelerated flow that appear in regions of wave overturning directly above the mountain is approximately compensated by momentum gained in other nearby patches of accelerated flow. The domain-average mean flow deceleration in the O(400 km) domain is not determined solely by the divergence of the horizontally averaged momentum flux, {$\langle\rho$}\textasciimacron u{${'}$}w{${'}\rangle$}, because differences in the upstream and downstream values of {$\rho$}u2+p provide nontrivial contributions to the total domain-averaged momentum budget. As confirmed by additional simulations in an O(1000 km) wide periodic domain, terrain-induced perturbations in the pressure and horizontal velocity fields are rapidly transmitted hundreds of kilometers away from the mountain and distributed as a small-amplitude signal over a very broad area far away from the mountain. These results suggest that both {$\langle\rho$}\textasciimacron u{${'}$}w{${'}\rangle$} and information about the wave-induced horizontal momentum fluxes need to be parameterized in order to completely define the local subgrid-scale forcing associated with mountain wave propagation and breakdown. The forcing for the globally averaged mean flow deceleration can, nevertheless, be determined solely from the vertical divergence of {$\langle\rho$}\textasciimacron u{${'}$}w{${'}\rangle$}. A simpler description of the local mean flow response to gravity wave propagation and breakdown may be obtained using pseudomomentum diagnostics. When the velocities in the unperturbed cross-mountain flow are positive, the vertical pseudomomentum flux is negative and may be regarded as an upward flux of negative pseudomomentum whose source is the cross-mountain pressure drag. In regions where the waves are steady and not undergoing dissipation the horizontal average of the vertical pseudomomentum flux is constant with height. The sinks for this flux are located in the regions of wave dissipation. Unlike the conventional perturbation momentum, the pseudomomentum perturbations generated by breaking mountain waves are all negative. According to the pseudomomentum viewpoint, the signature of gravity wave drag is a secular increase in the strength of the negative pseudomomentum anomalies generated by wave dissipation. In contrast to the behavior of the perturbation momentum, the average rate of pseudomomentum loss in an O(400 km) domain surrounding the mountain is a significant fraction of the total decelerative forcing provided by the cross-mountain pressure drag. Since pseudomomentum is a second-order quantity that decays rapidly upstream and downstream of the mountain, the horizontally averaged pseudomomentum budget can be closed in open domains of reasonable finite size without explicitly accounting for the pseudomomentum fluxes through the lateral boundaries, and thus, the temporal changes in the horizontally averaged pseudomomentum can be determined solely from the divergence of the vertical pseudomomentum flux. Momentum and pseudomomentum perturbations in trapped mountain lee waves are also investigated. These waves generate nontrivial domain-averaged pseudomomentum perturbations in the low-level flow and should be considered an important potential source of low-level gravity wave drag. These waves are, however, inviscid, and the pseudomomentum perturbations do not grow as a result of dissipation but rather as a result of wave transience through the continued downstream expansion of the wave train.},

  abstract = {Leaky trapped mountain lee waves are investigated by examining the structure of individual linear modes in multilayer atmospheres. When the static stability and cross-mountain wind speed are constant in the topmost unbounded layer, modes that decay exponentially downstream also grow exponentially with height. This growth with height occurs because packets containing relatively large-amplitude waves follow ray paths through the stratosphere, placing them above packets entering the stratosphere farther downstream that contain relatively low-amplitude waves. Nevertheless, if the trapped wave train is generated by a compact source, all waves disappear above some line parallel to the group velocity that passes just above the source region.},

  abstract = {An acoustic propagation experiment over 308 km range conducted in the Canary Basin in 1997\textendash 1998 was used to assess the ability of ocean acoustic tomography to measure the flux of Mediterranean water and Meddies. Instruments on a mooring adjacent to the acoustic path measured the southwestward passage of a strong Meddy in temperature, salinity, and current. Over 9 months of transmissions, the acoustic arrival pattern was an initial broad stochastic pulse varying in duration by 250\textendash 500 ms, followed eight stable, identified-ray arrivals. Small-scale sound speed fluctuations from Mediterranean water parcels littered around the sound channel axis caused acoustic scattering. Internal waves contributed more modest acoustic scattering. Based on simulations, the main effect of a Meddy passing across the acoustic path is the formation of many early-arriving, near-axis rays, but these rays are thoroughly scattered by the small-scale Mediterranean-water fluctuations. A Meddy decreases the deep-turning ray travel times by 10\textendash 30 ms. The dominant acoustic signature of a Meddy is therefore the expansion of the width of the initial stochastic pulse. While this signature appears inseparable from the other effects of Mediterranean water in this region, the acoustic time series indicates the steady passage of Mediterranean water across the acoustic path. Tidal variations caused by the mode-1 internal tides were measured by the acoustic travel times. The observed internal tides were partly predicted using a recent global model for such tides derived from satellite altimetry.},

  abstract = {Abstract Barotropic tidal currents flowing over rough topography may be slowed by two bottom boundary?related processes: tangential stress of the bottom boundary layer, which is generally well represented by a quadratic drag law, and normal stress from bottom pressure, known as form drag. Form drag is rarely estimated from oceanic observations because it is difficult to measure the bottom pressure over a large spatial domain. The ?external? and ?internal? components of the form drag are associated, respectively, with sea surface and isopycnals deformations. This study presents model and observational estimates of the components of drag for Three Tree Point, a sloping ridge projecting 1 km into Puget Sound, Washington. Internal form drag was integrated from repeat microstructure sections and exceeded the net drag due to bottom friction by a factor of 10?50 during maximum flood. In observations and numerical simulations, form drag was produced by a lee wave, as well as by horizontal flow separation in the model. The external form drag was not measured, but in numerical simulations was found to be comparable to the internal form drag. Form drag appears to be the primary mechanism for extracting energy from the barotropic tide. Turbulent buoyancy flux is strongest near the ridge in both observations and model results.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The dynamical role of geothermal heating in abyssal circulation is reconsidered using three independent arguments. First, we show that a uniform geothermal heat flux close to the observed average (86.4 mW m-2) supplies as much heat to near-bottom water as a diapycnal mixing rate of \textasciitilde 10-4 m2 s-1 \textendash{} the canonical value thought to be responsible for the magnitude of the present-day abyssal circulation. This parity raises the possibility that geothermal heating could have a dynamical impact of the same order. Second, we estimate the magnitude of geothermally-induced circulation with the density-binning method (Walin, 1982), applied to the observed thermohaline structure of Levitus (1998). The method also allows to investigate the effect of realistic spatial variations of the flux obtained from heatflow measurements and classical theories of lithospheric cooling. It is found that a uniform heatflow forces a transformation of \textasciitilde 6 Sv at {$\sigma$}4=45.90, which is of the same order as current best estimates of AABW circulation. This transformation can be thought of as the geothermal circulation in the absence of mixing and is very similar for a realistic heatflow, albeit shifted towards slightly lighter density classes. Third, we use a general ocean circulation model in global configuration to perform three sets of experiments: (1) a thermally homogenous abyssal ocean with and without uniform geothermal heating; (2) a more stratified abyssal ocean subject to (i) no geothermal heating, (ii) a constant heat flux of 86.4 mW m-2, (iii) a realistic, spatially varying heat flux of identical global average; (3) experiments (i) and (iii) with enhanced vertical mixing at depth. Geothermal heating and diapycnal mixing are found to interact non-linearly through the density field, with geothermal heating eroding the deep stratification supporting a downward diffusive flux, while diapycnal mixing acts to map near-surface temperature gradients onto the bottom, thereby altering the density structure that supports a geothermal circulation. For strong vertical mixing rates, geothermal heating enhances the AABW cell by about 15\% (2.5 Sv) and heats up the last 2000 m by \textasciitilde 0.15\textdegree C, reaching a maximum of by 0.3\textdegree C in the deep North Pacific. Prescribing a realistic spatial distribution of the heat flux acts to enhance this temperature rise at mid-depth and reduce it at great depth, producing a more modest increase in overturning than in the uniform case. In all cases, however, poleward heat transport increases by \textasciitilde 10\% in the Southern Ocean. The three approaches converge to the conclusion that geothermal heating is an important actor of abyssal dynamics, and should no longer be neglected in oceanographic studies.},

Previous observations of such periodic variations have been limited to the coastal ocean and estuaries, where horizontal density gradients are maintained by river runoff or differential heating. In the present study, we show evidence for the existence of tidal straining over the continental shelf, outside any regions of freshwater influence, where horizontal density gradients are likely to result from the projection of the interior vertical stratification onto sloping topography. Based on microstructure data obtained in the East China Sea, we demonstrate that the tidal current shear interacting with the cross-isobath density gradient results in semidiurnal switching between unstable and stable stratification in the lower part of the BBL. The cycle of turbulent dissipation is quarter-diurnal, corresponding to the semidiurnal variation of tidal current shear. In addition, a noticeable diurnal modulation in stratification as well as a significant diurnal cycle of turbulent dissipation are observed in the upper part of the BBL, where the time evolution of stratification is dominated by tidal advection, rather than tidal straining.},

  abstract = {In September 2003, microstructure and fine-scale shear (vertical derivative of horizontal current) and strain (vertical derivative of isopycnal displacements) profiles were collected in Storfjorden, Svalbard Archipelago. Storfjorden is a sillfjord of significant dense water production and the period of observations corresponds to weak overflow conditions of the dense water. The data set comprises fine-scale measurements combined with simultaneous dissipation and buoyancy frequency profiles and allows for evaluation of various turbulence scalings and internal wave\textendash wave interaction models. Microstructure profiles identified high levels of background vertical diffusivity, Kr, O(10\`A4) m2 s\`A1, which increased by one order within the overflow. Fine-scale shear and strain spectral levels were found to be elevated above those of Garrett\textendash Munk, consistent with the observed enhanced mixing, whereas their average ratio was comparable to that of Garrett\textendash Munk. Among the internal wave\textendash wave interaction models, a shear\textendash strain model agreed with the observations (between the surface and bottom mixed layers) within a factor of 2, on the average. A scaling of the dissipation, e, in the form of total-energy \^A N suggests that approximately 0.5\% of the energy is dissipated per buoyancy period, 2p/N. The best-fit power-law scaling between diffusivity and N is KrpN\`A1.4 (70.2). For this environment, a parameterization of the form of Pacanowski\textendash Philander is suggested with background levels of eddy viscosity and diffusivity elevated by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The ocean circulation is a cause and consequence of fluid scale interactions ranging from millimeters to more than 10,000 km. Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10\% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100\textendash 200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior.},

  abstract = {Abstract Western Pacific central and tropical waters characterized by a subsurface salinity maximum spread into the Indonesian seas as part of the Indonesian throughflow. Within the Indonesian seas this salinity maximum is attenuated and, in some places, completely removed. A simple advection-diffusion model verifies the importance of vertical mixing in the transformation of Western Pacific waters to Indonesian thermocline water. The profiles indicate a predominant North Pacific presence in most of the seas, although some South Pacific water is present in the eastern ses of Halmahera, Seram, and Banda. The main interocean route is through the western seas of Sulawesi, Makassar, and Flores, while the flow pathway in the eastern seas is less certain. The Banda Sea can be renewed from either the northern passages (Halmahera and Maluku) or from the south via the Flores Sea. Using representative basin property profiles derived from the archieved data allows determination of a range of vertical diffusivities and residence times that best reproduce the transformation of Pacific waters into Indonesian water. In the Makassar thermocline a lower limit of 1 \texttimes{} 10-4 m2 s-1 for vertical diffusivity is inferred from the model results with reasonable throughflow and precipitation values. This estimate is roughly an order of magnitude greater than those deduced for the interior oceanic thermocline in an environment not conductive to salt fingers. In the Banda Sea a Kz of 1 \texttimes{} 10-4 m2 s-1 implies a predominant North Pacific source. If Kz is higher, then a larger South Pacific presence is possible.},

  abstract = {Profiles of potential density obtained from CTD casts at two stations at different distances from the Hawaiian ridge are examined for evidence of diapycnal turbulent mixing as indicated by density inversions and internalwave vertical strain. Results from independent casts are used to produce ensemble-averaged vertical distributions for the number of inversions and the Thorpe scale. Both parameters were found to be higher over the slope of the topography at 2500-m depth than in the deep ocean, 110 km to the north. Thorpe scale\textendash based estimates of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent vertical diffusivity are elevated by an order of magnitude over the slope relative to deep ocean background levels. The vertical distributions of these mixing parameters are nonuniform and exhibit signs of locally enhanced dissipation, possibly due to internal tides generated at the ridge. At the deep station, turbulence is at background levels from the surface down to 2000 m. Below this, a localized zone of enhanced mixing is observed, within which the dissipation rate is O(1029 W kg21) and turbulent diffusivity is greater than O(1024 m2 s21), perhaps due to an internal tide ray originating at the ridge. The full-depth topographical enhancement of mixing near the ridge also appears in the vertical strain field. Estimates of dissipation rate and turbulent diffusivity, based on an internal wave\textendash wave interaction model, give results similar to direct Thorpe scale methods, except in weakly stratified environments where both methods are subject to uncertainty. Near the topography, the variation in mixing intensity observed between casts is sensitive to sporadic large mixing events, which are triggered by internal waves associated with the spring tide. The upper portion of the water column (stronger stratification) is more responsive to the tide than the deep regions.},

Here we examine the wind work in a pair of global, very high-resolution (1/48\,\textdegree{} and 1/24\,\textdegree ) MIT general circulation model simulations in Latitude-Longitude-polar Cap (LLC) configuration that provide hourly output at spatial resolutions of a few kilometers and include tidal forcing. A cospectrum analysis of wind stress and ocean surface currents shows positive contribution at large scales (\textquestiondown 300 km) and near-inertial frequency and negative contribution from mesoscales, tidal frequencies, and internal gravity waves. Larger surface kinetic energy fluxes are in the Kuroshio in winter at large scales (40 mW/m2) and mesoscales (-30 mW/m2). The Kerguelen region is dominated by large scale ({$\sim$}20 mW/m2), followed by inertial oscillations in summer (13 mW/m2) and mesoscale in winter (-12 mW/m2). Kinetic energy fluxes from internal gravity waves (-0.1 to -9.9 mW/m2) are generally stronger in summer. Surface kinetic energy fluxes in the LLC simulations are 4.71 TW, which is 25\textendash 85 \% higher than previous global estimates from coarser (1/6\textendash 1/10\,\textdegree ) general ocean circulation models; this is likely due to improved representation of wind variability (6-hourly, 0.14\,\textdegree, operational European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). However, the low wind power input to the near-inertial frequency band obtained with LLC (0.16 TW) compared to global slab models suggests that wind variability on time scales less than 6 hr and spatial scales less than 15 km are critical to better representing the wind power input in ocean circulation models.},

  abstract = {Changes in properties and quantity of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) have major implications for the climate system, through sequestration of heat and carbon into, and ventilation of, the abyssal ocean. Yet, it remains one of the most difficult water masses to observe. An array of 12 Deep Argo floats, capable of profiling from the surface to the seafloor and under sea ice, provides a new perspective on AABW in the Australian-Antarctic Basin. Over 2 years of data from the floats illuminate AABW properties with unprecedented detail, simultaneously sampling AABW at multiple locations, year-round, throughout the basin. Calibrating each float individually with nearby, quasi-simultaneous shipboard profiles ensures the highest quality salinity data, with estimated accuracy of {$\pm$}0.005 or better. Pathways of Ross Sea and Ad\'elie Land Bottom Water (RSBW and ALBW), defined by their unique temperature and salinity characteristics, are mapped along the continental slope from their respective sources. The main pathway of RSBW, identified by its characteristic deep salinity maximum, is inferred to be inshore of the 3,700 m isobath, where it cools and freshens westward along the slope before interacting with ALBW near 140\textdegree E. A pulse of very cold and very fresh (nearly -0.6\textdegree C, 34.82 g kg-1) ALBW appears in February 2019, highlighting temporal variability on daily scales near its source. Deep Argo has greatly enhanced our view of AABW in the Australian-Antarctic Basin and will prove to be an essential tool for monitoring future changes in the deep ocean by drastically increasing observations in a cost-effective way.},

Here we present a comparison of a trans-Pacific survey completed in 1985 (refs 4, 5) and its repetition in 1999 (ref. 6). We find that the deepest waters of the North Pacific Ocean have warmed significantly across the entire width of the ocean basin.

Great progress has been made in understanding the sources of energy for mixing, the mechanisms, and the rates. On the other hand, we still do not have adequate answers to first order questions such as the extent to which the thermohaline circulation of the ocean, and hence the earth's climate, is sensitive to the present mixing rates in the ocean interior. Internal waves, generated by either wind or flow over topography, appear to be the principle cause of mixing. Mean and eddy flows over topography generate internal lee waves, while tidal flows over topography generate internal tides. The relative importance of these different internal wave sources is unknown. There are also great uncertainties about the spatial and temporal variation of mixing. Calculations of internal tide generation are becoming increasingly robust, but we do not know enough about the subsequent behavior of internal tides and their eventual breakdown into turbulence. It does seem, however, that most internal tide energy flux is radiated away from generation sites as low modes that propagate over basin scales. The mechanisms of wave-wave interaction and topographic scattering both act to transfer wave energy from low modes to smaller dissipative scales.},

  abstract = {Global differences of temperature and buoyancy flux at the ocean surface are responsible for small-scale convection at high latitudes, global overturning, and the top-to-bottom density difference in the oceans. With planetary rotation the convection also contributes to the large-scale horizontal, geostrophic circulation, and it crucially involves a 3D linkage between the geostrophic circulation and vertical overturning. The governing dynamics of such a surface-forced convective flow are fundamentally different from Rayleigh\textendash B\'enard convection, and the role of buoyancy forcing in the oceans is poorly understood. Geostrophic balance adds to the constraints on transport in horizontal convection, as illustrated by experiments, theoretical scaling, and turbulence-resolving simulations for closed (mid-latitude) basins and an annulus or reentrant zonal (circumpolar) channel. In these geometries, buoyancy drives either horizontal mid-latitude gyre recirculations or a strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, respectively, in addition to overturning. At large Rayleigh numbers the release of available potential energy by convection leads to turbulent mixing with a mixing efficiency approaching unity. Turbulence-resolving models are also revealing the relative roles of wind stress and buoyancy when there is mixed forcing, and in future work they need to include the effects of turbulent mixing due to energy input from tides.},

Theoretically, owing to how the ocean circulates, this cooling should be recorded in Pacific deep-ocean temperatures, where water that was on the surface then is found today. Gebbie and Huybers used an ocean circulation model and observations from both the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century to detect and quantify this trend. The ongoing deep Pacific is cooling, which revises Earth's overall heat budget since 1750 downward by 35\%.

The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.},

However, this aspect has never been confirmed by any quantitative measure, nor is the position of the control section known. This paper presents a comparison of several different techniques for assessing the hydraulic criticality of oceanic overflows applied to data from a set of velocity and hydrographic sections across the FBC. These include 1) the cross-stream variation in the local Froude number, including a modified form that accounts for stratification and vertical shear, 2) rotating hydraulic solutions using a constant potential vorticity layer in a channel of parabolic cross section, and 3) direct computation of shallow water wave speeds from the observed overflow structure. Though differences exist, the three methods give similar answers, suggesting that the FBC is indeed controlled, with a critical section located 20\textendash 90 km downstream of the sill crest. Evidence of an upstream control with respect to a potential vorticity wave is also presented. The implications of these results for hydraulic predictions of overflow transport and variability are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a novel approach to processing records of ambient noise in the ocean that are measured concurrently in spatially separated locations. The approach is a synthesis of two well-known phase-coherent signal processing techniques. At the first stage of processing, an approximation to the transient acoustic Green function is found by the method of noise interferometry. At the second stage, the approximate Green function is time reversed and back propagated from the location of one of the receivers, thereby producing a focus in the vicinity of the other receiver. Unlike the earlier work, measurements at just two points (rather than vertical array measurements) are used when the sound-propagation range is large compared to the ocean depth. The requirement for optimal focusing of the back-propagated field is shown to lead to extraction of estimates of the unknown physical parameters of the waveguide and, hence, to passive acoustic remote sensing of the ocean.},

Parameterizations of efficiency and of related mixing coefficients are needed to estimate diapycnal diffusivity from measurements of the turbulent dissipation rate. Comparing diffusivities from microstructure profiling with those inferred from the thickening rate of four simultaneous tracer releases has verified, within observational accuracy, 0.2 as the mixing coefficient over a 30-fold range of diapycnal diffusivities. Although some mixing coefficients can be estimated from pycnocline measurements, at present mixing efficiency must be obtained from channel flows, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations. Reviewing the different approaches demonstrates that estimates and parameterizations for mixing efficiency and coefficients are not converging beyond the at-sea comparisons with tracer releases, leading to recommendations for a community approach to address this important issue.},

This paper summarizes the formulation of the ocean component to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL) climate model used for the 4th IPCC Assessment (AR4) of global climate change. In particular, it reviews the numerical schemes and physical parameterizations that make up an ocean climate model and how these schemes are pieced together for use in a state-of-the-art climate model. Features of the model described here include the following: (1) tripolar grid to resolve the Arctic Ocean without polar filtering, (2) partial bottom step representation of topography to better represent topographically influenced advective and wave processes, (3) more accurate equation of state, (4) three-dimensional flux limited tracer advection to reduce overshoots and undershoots, (5) incorporation of regional climatological variability in shortwave penetration, (6) neutral physics parameterization for representation of the pathways of tracer transport, (7) staggered time stepping for tracer conservation and numerical efficiency, (8) anisotropic horizontal viscosities for representation of equatorial currents, (9) parameterization of exchange with marginal seas, (10) incorporation of a free surface that accomodates a dynamic ice model and wave propagation, (11) transport of water across the ocean free surface to eliminate unphysical ``virtual tracer flux" methods, (12) parameterization of tidal mixing on continental shelves. We also present preliminary analyses of two particularly important sensitivities isolated during the development process, namely the details of how parameterized subgridscale eddies transport momentum and tracers.},

Their tool is a suite of centennial-scale 1990 radiatively forced numerical climate simulations from three GFDL coupled models comprising the Climate Model, version 2.0\textendash Ocean (CM2-O), model suite. CM2-O models differ in their ocean resolution: CM2.6 uses a 0.1\textdegree{} ocean grid, CM2.5 uses an intermediate grid with 0.25\textdegree{} spacing, and CM2-1deg uses a nominal 1.0\textdegree{} grid.             Analysis of the ocean heat budget reveals that mesoscale eddies act to transport heat upward in a manner that partially compensates (or offsets) for the downward heat transport from the time-mean currents. Stronger vertical eddy heat transport in CM2.6 relative to CM2.5 accounts for the significantly smaller temperature drift in CM2.6. The mesoscale eddy parameterization used in CM2-1deg also imparts an upward heat transport, yet it differs systematically from that found in CM2.6. This analysis points to the fundamental role that ocean mesoscale features play in transient ocean heat uptake. In general, the more accurate simulation found in CM2.6 provides an argument for either including a rich representation of the ocean mesoscale in model simulations of the mean and transient climate or for employing parameterizations that faithfully reflect the role of eddies in both lateral and vertical heat transport.},

The Faroe Bank Channel (FBC) is the deepest passage across the Greenland\textendash Scotland Ridge (GSR) and there is a continuous deep flow of cold and dense water passing through it from the Arctic Mediterranean into the North Atlantic and further to the rest of the world ocean. This FBC overflow is part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which has recently been suggested to have weakened. From November 1995 to May 2015, the FBC overflow has been monitored by a continuous ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) mooring, which has been deployed in the middle of this narrow channel. Combined with regular hydrography cruises and several short-term mooring experiments, this allowed us to construct time series of volume transport and to follow changes in the hydrographic properties and density of the FBC overflow. The mean kinematic overflow, derived solely from the velocity field, was found to be (2.2\,{$\pm$}\,0.2)\,Sv (1\,Sv\,\,=\,\,106\,m3\,s-1) with a slight, but not statistically significant, positive trend. The coldest part, and probably the bulk, of the FBC overflow warmed by a bit more than 0.1\,\textdegree C, especially after 2002, increasing the transport of heat into the deep ocean. This warming was, however, accompanied by increasing salinities, which seem to have compensated for the temperature-induced density decrease. Thus, the FBC overflow has remained stable in volume transport as well as density during the 2 decades from 1995 to 2015. After crossing the GSR, the overflow is modified by mixing and entrainment, but the associated change in volume (and heat) transport is still not well known. Whatever effect this has on the AMOC and the global energy balance, our observed stability of the FBC overflow is consistent with reported observations from the other main overflow branch, the Denmark Strait overflow, and the three Atlantic inflow branches to the Arctic Mediterranean that feed the overflows. If the AMOC has weakened during the last 2 decades, it is not likely to have been due to its northernmost extension \textendash{} the exchanges across the Greenland\textendash Scotland Ridge.},

  abstract = {The Faroe Bank Channel (FBC) is the deepest passage across the Greenland\textendash Scotland Ridge and there is continuous overflow of dense water through the channel, which provides a substantial contribution to the global thermohaline circulation. Since November 1995, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) have been moored at the sill of the channel continuously, except for short annual servicing periods. In addition to this, CTD sections have regularly been occupied across the channel and instruments, recording temperature and salinity, have been moored for short periods. These observations demonstrate that the channel, due to its small width, can be monitored fairly well with only one ADCP mooring and they allow the generation of a time-series of overflow volume flux for the 1995\textendash 2005 period. The kinematic overflow flux, defined solely from the velocity field, was found to have an average value of 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 Sv with a seasonal and with inter-annual variations of approximately 10\% amplitude, but with no discernible trend for the whole period. The average flux of water with potential density exceeding 27.8 kg m\`A3 was found to be 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3 Sv with average properties: h = 0.25 \textdegree C, S = 34.93, ch = 28.01 kg m\`A3 for this period. No evidence was found for a weakening overflow flux, but the salinity of the FBC-overflow, especially the warmer parts, has increased substantially during the period, which implies an increased average density on the order of 0.01 kg m\`A3. Previous observations of a helical cross-channel circulation are confirmed and may explain the thin pycnocline layer, but shear-instability induces intensive mixing that puts a lower limit on the layer thickness. Critical control at one point of the sill cross-section, rather than friction, seems to govern the overflow dynamics and simple layered models can explain much of the observed features as well as the seasonal variation, but potential vorticity, as defined for a single overflow layer, is not conserved. A previously suggested 1950\textendash 2000 weakening of the FBC-overflow, which was partly based on a subset of the data presented here, is not supported by the full dataset.},

It is found that the work done on the long waves by the interaction stresses (corresponding to Longuet-Higgins' `maser' mechanism of wave generation) is almost exactly balanced by the loss of potential energy arising from the mass transfer. The residual energy transfer leads to attenuation of the long waves, independent of their propagation direction relative to the short waves. Damping factors are estimated from the upwind\textendash downwind ratios of radar backscatter cross-sections. It is found that interactions with waves shorter than 35cm yield attenuation rates about an order of magnitude smaller than the observed growth rates due to the wind.},

  abstract = {Data from a mooring array deployed north of Denmark Strait from September 2011 to August 2012 are used to investigate the structure and variability of the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC). The shelfbreak EGC is a surface-intensified current situated just offshore of the east Greenland shelf break flowing southward through Denmark Strait. This study identified two dominant spatial modes of variability within the current: a pulsing mode and a meandering mode, both of which were most pronounced in fall and winter. A particularly energetic event in November 2011 was related to a reversal of the current for nearly a month. In addition to the seasonal signal, the current was associated with periods of enhanced eddy kinetic energy and increased variability on shorter time scales. The data indicate that the current is, for the most part, barotropically stable but subject to baroclinic instability from September to March. By contrast, in summer the current is mainly confined to the shelf break with decreased eddy kinetic energy and minimal baroclinic conversion. No other region of the Nordic Seas displays higher levels of eddy kinetic energy than the shelfbreak EGC north of Denmark Strait during fall. This appears to be due to the large velocity variability on mesoscale time scales generated by the instabilities. The mesoscale variability documented here may be a source of the variability observed at the Denmark Strait sill.},

  abstract = {Abstract A theory is presented for time-dependent two-layer hydraulic flows through straits. The theory is used to study exchange flows forced by a periodic barotropic (tidal) flow. For a given strait geometry the resulting flow is a function of two nondimensional parameters, {$\gamma$} = (g{${'}$}H)1/2T/L and qb0 = ub0/(g{${'}$}H)1/2. Here g{${'}$}, H, L, T, and ub0 are, respectively, the reduced gravity, strait depth and length scales, the forcing period, and the barotropic velocity amplitude; {$\gamma$} is a measure of the dynamic length of the strait and qb0 a measure of the forcing strength. Numerical solutions for both a pure contraction and an offset sill-narrows combination show that the exchange flow, averaged over a tidal cycle, increases with qb0 for a fixed {$\gamma$}. For fixed qb0 the exchange increases with increasing {$\gamma$}. The maximum exchange is obtained in the quasi-steady limit {$\gamma\rightarrow\infty$}. The minimum exchange is found for {$\gamma\rightarrow$}0 and is equal to the unforced steady exchange. The usual concept of hydraulic control occurs only in these two limits of {$\gamma$}. In the time-dependent regime complete information on the strait geometry, not just at a finite number of control points, is required to determine the exchange. The model results are compared to laboratory experiments for the pure contraction case. Good agreement for both interface evolution and average exchange is found if account is made for the role of mixing, which acts to reduce the average salt (density) transport. The relevance of these results to ocean straits is discussed. It is shown that many typical straits lie in the region of parameter space where time dependence is important. Application to the Strait of Gibraltar helps explain the success of the unforced steady hydraulic theory.},

  abstract = {Abstract The flow in a source-fed f-plane basin drained through a strait is explored using a single-layer (reduced gravity) shallow-water numerical model that resolves the hydraulic flow within the strait. The steady upstream basin circulation is found to be sensitive to the nature of the mass source (uniform downwelling, localized downwelling, or boundary inflow). In contrast, the hydraulically controlled flow in the strait is nearly independent of the basin circulation and agrees very well with the Gill-theory solution obtained using the strait geometry and the numerically determined average potential vorticity in the strait entrance region. This Gill solution, however, gives a unique value of the upstream boundary layer flux splitting that does not agree with any of the full numerical solutions. The coupled basin\textendash strait system is shown to select an average overflow potential vorticity corresponding to the Gill solution with maximum fluid depth on the strait boundaries. This state also corresponds to one of maximal upstream basin potential energy. This result is robust to changes in the basin geometry, strait characteristics, the dissipation parameter (linear drag), and the net mass flux. The nonunique relation between basin conditions and overflow transport is significant with regard to deep overflow transport monitoring. It is shown that the potential vorticity selection leads to overflow, or ``weir,'' transport relations that are well approximated by the zero potential vorticity theory. However, accurate estimates of the transport can only be obtained if conditions within the strait entrance region, and not the basin, are used.},

Southern Ocean temperature and density averaged over 1986-2005 from 15 CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) climate models are compared with an observed climatology, focusing on bottom water. Bottom properties are reasonably accurate for half the models. Ten models create dense water on the Antarctic shelf, but it mixes with lighter water and is not exported as bottom water as in reality. Instead, most models create deep water by open ocean deep convection, a process occurring rarely in reality. Models with extensive deep convection are those with strong seasonality in sea ice. Optimum bottom properties occur in models with deep convection in the Weddell and Ross Gyres. Bottom Water formation processes are poorly represented in ocean models and are a key challenge for improving climate predictions.},

The mean of 24 models shows a decrease in density in all deep basins, except the North Atlantic, which becomes denser. The individual model responses to climate change forcing are more complex: regarding temperature, the 24 models predict a warming of the bottom layer of the global ocean; in salinity, there is less agreement regarding the sign of the change, especially in the Southern Ocean. The magnitude and equatorward extent of these changes also vary strongly among models. The changes in properties can be linked with changes in the mean transport of key water masses. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakens in most models and is directly linked to changes in bottom density in the North Atlantic. These changes are the result of the intrusion of modified Antarctic Bottom Water, made possible by the decrease in North Atlantic Deep Water formation. In the Indian, Pacific, and South Atlantic Oceans, changes in bottom density are congruent with the weakening in Antarctic Bottom Water transport through these basins. The authors argue that the greater the 1986?2005 meridional transports, the more changes have propagated equatorward by 2100. However, strong decreases in density over 100 yr of climate change cause a weakening of the transports. The speed at which these property changes reach the deep basins is critical for a correct assessment of the heat storage capacity of the oceans as well as for predictions of future sea level rise.},

  abstract = {The behavior of nonstationary trapped lee waves in a nonsteady background flow is studied using idealized three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations. Trapped waves are forced by the passage of an isolated, synopticscale barotropic jet over a mountain ridge of finite length. Trapped waves generated within this environment differ significantly in their behavior compared with waves in the more commonly studied two-dimensional (2D) steady flow. After the peak zonal flow has crossed the terrain, two disparate regions form within the mature wave train: 1) upwind of the jet maximum, trapped waves increase their wavelength and tend to untrap and decay, whereas 2) downwind of the jet maximum, wavelengths shorten and waves remain trapped. Waves start to untrap approximately 100 km downwind of the ridge top, and the region of untrapping expands downwind with time as the jet progresses, while waves downstream of the jet maximum persist. Wentzel\textendash Kramers\textendash Brillouin (WKB) ray tracing shows that spatial gradients in the mean flow are the key factor responsible for these behaviors. An example of real-world waves evolving similarly to the modeled waves is presented.},

A reference level for geostrophic shear is developed heuristically and by comparison with sea-surface altimetry. The mean northward transport in the upper waters is 6.7 {$\pm$} 3.7 Sv and there is a 6.1 {$\pm$} 2.5 Sv southward flow below the thermocline. Although the magnitude of the Iceland Basin overturning circulation (4.3 {$\pm$} 1.9 Sv) is greater than in the Rockall Trough (3.0 {$\pm$} 3.7 Sv), the variability is greater in the Rockall Trough. We discuss the results in the context of our understanding of drivers of variability.},

  abstract = {A geological and geophysical study of the Samoan Passage in the west equatorial Pacific (168-170\textdegree W; 7-10\textdegree S) was carried out in 1971, utilizing underway seismic reflection profiles (3.5 kHz and sparker), bottom photographs, bottom current measurements, bottom water temperature profiles, and sediment cores. These data and those of previous expeditions were synthesized in this study of dynamic sedimentation processes. Specific sedimentation processes were found to be associated with surface (12 kHz) and subsurface (3.5 kHz) morphology and composition of the sea floor. (1) Parabolic echo returns, rugged topography, some local conformable subbottom penetration ({$<$} 10 m); process- pelagic draping of sediment, infrequent slumping (Passage walls). (2) Highly reflective, smooth topography, no subbottom penetration, manganese nodules on semi-indurated sediment; process- continued fast (20-50 cm/sec) bottom current flow causing erosion or non-deposition (Passage axis). (3) Moderately reflective bottom with up to 20 m of subbottom penetration lying over (2) above, compact unfossiliferous zeolitic and ash-rich clay containing some manganese nodules; process-slow deposition of compact sediment from bottom currents (5-10 cm/sec), the "wind slab effect" (lee portion of Passage and in certain areas north of the Passage). (4) Very weakly reflective bottom with up to 80 m of subbottom penetration, watery abyssal brown clays interbedded with reworked and cross bedded biogenic ooze; process-rapid accumulation of sediment from waning sediment-laden bottom currents (north of Passage). The sedimentary record in and around the Passage indicates that relatively intense current flow through the Passage was initiated at some time between the early Eocene and early Oligocene, and continued through most of the Tertiary. Lithologic data suggest significant periodic fluctuations in corrosive effects of bottom currents during the Quaternary.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In situ observations obtained over the last several decades have shown that the intensity of turbulent mixing in the abyssal ocean is enhanced toward the seafloor. Consequently, a new paradigm has emerged whereby dianeutral downwelling dominates in the ocean interior and dianeutral upwelling only occurs within thin bottom boundary layers. This study shows that when mixing is bottom intensified the net abyssal dianeutral transports and the stratification can depend on subtle features of the seafloor geometry. Under an assumption of depth-independent net dianeutral upwelling, small changes in the curvature of the seafloor can result in interior stratification that is bottom intensified, uniform, or surface intensified. Further, when the net dianeutral transport is allowed to vary in the vertical, changes in the seafloor slope and bathymetric contour length with height can drive lateral exchange between the boundary layer and interior, with particularly strong lateral outflows predicted at the crests of midocean ridges. Finally, using a realistic neutral density climatology the authors suggest that the increase in the perimeter of abyssal neutral density surfaces with height drives much of the dianeutral upwelling at depths greater than 4 km, while the increase in the slope of the seafloor at shallower depths acts to oppose upwelling. These results add to a growing body of literature highlighting the key control of seafloor geometry on the abyssal overturning circulation.},

A general framework for stratified turbulence is used for this purpose; first, it highlights the importance of available potential energy in facilitating the transfer of kinetic energy to the background potential energy (defined as the adiabatically rearranged state with no motion). Next, it is shown that it is the rate of transfer between different energy reservoirs that is important for the maintenance of the ocean overturning, rather than the total amount of potential or kinetic energy. A series of numerical experiments is used to assess which energy transfers are significant in the overturning circulation. In the steady state, the rate of irreversible diapycnal mixing is necessarily balanced by the production of available potential energy sourced from surface buoyancy fluxes. Thus, the external inputs of available potential energy from surface buoyancy forcing and of kinetic energy from other sources (such as surface winds and tides, and leading to turbulent mixing) are both necessary to maintain the overturning circulation.},

In addition to using the Munk [Munk, W.H., 1966. Abyssal recipes. Deep-Sea Research 13, 707\textendash 730] advection\textendash diffusion balance in the ocean interior, we close the circulation by including the small high-latitude sinking regions, which are assumed to be turbulent geostrophic gravity currents on gentle topographic slopes. The interior and sinking regions are coupled by turbulent entrainment into the sinking regions and we examine the global influence of this entrainment. An important realization is that the rates of mixing into slope currents, predicted to be very small as a function of along-flow distance, imply rates of entrainment per unit depth of fall that are comparable to the entrainment rate for vertical plumes. The overturning mass flux and ocean density stratification are found as a function of the vertical diffusivity and total heat transport. Given a realistic heat transport and the measured average mixing rate of order 10-5m2/s, this simple model yields predictions consistent with data for the increase in volume flux with depth in slope currents, the magnitude of the global overturning circulation, and the averaged top-to-bottom density difference. Despite the absence of other mechanisms thought to be important in the thermocline, the model also gives a realistic thermal boundary layer thickness. As a consequence of entrainment into the dense sinking currents, the linking of abyssal densities to surface fluxes and the assumption of a uniform diffusivity, the model convective flow requires much less energy than the Munk (1966) prediction. The results indicate that the ocean overturning is feasibly a convective one and we suggest there might be no need to search for `missing' mixing.},

However, there are several confusing definitions. Here we compare and contrast patch-wise versus bulk estimates of mixing efficiency in the abyss by revisiting data from previous extensive field surveys in the Brazil Basin. Observed patch-wise efficiency is highly variable over a wide range of turbulence intensity. Bulk efficiency is dominated by rare extreme turbulence events. In the case where enhanced near-bottom turbulence is thought to be driven by breaking of small-scale internal tides, the estimated bulk efficiency is 20\%, close to the conventional value of 17\%. On the other hand, where enhanced near-bottom turbulence appears to be convectively driven by hydraulic overflows, bulk efficiency is suggested to be as large as 45\%, which has implications for a further significant role of overflow mixing on deep-water mass transformation.},

Strong winds, gusting to 30 m s\textendash 1, and heat fluxes up to 1000 W m\textendash 2 produced moderate-to-strong mixing in the surface mixed layer and the entrainment zone, as well as in the thermocline. In the limit of a vertically balanced heat budget, EDW formation is driven primarily by surface heat loss to the atmosphere across a region extending O(100) km south from the GS core, where entrainment heat fluxes based on dissipation rates were relatively low, O(10) to O(100) W m\textendash 2. Near the GS core, much larger entrainment fluxes, O(100) to O(1000) W m\textendash 2, contribute significantly to cooling the mixed layer, but less so to overall EDW formation due to its smaller volume. Relationships between observed dissipation rates and the atmospheric and local shear forcing scales are examined for this limited data set and compared with empirical scalings both within the mixed layer and in the entrainment zone. Below the mixed layer near the GS, diapycnal diffusivities in the thermocline averaged about O(10\textendash 4) m2 s\textendash 1, and are approximately 10 times levels previously observed in the GS during other seasons. Horizontally coherent shear structures, with shoaling phase and clockwise rotation, indicate that downward-propagating near-inertial waves are responsible for much of this enhanced subsurface mixing.},

  abstract = {The residual diapycnal overturning circulation through interior regions of the Nordic Seas is diagnosed. The mean flow is estimated from Ekman dynamics and from the thermal wind relation with reference level velocities deduced from observations and from simplified theory. Eddy-induced transport is estimated from a GM-type parameterization which includes top and bottom boundary layers. The contributions from the Eulerian mean and eddy-induced transport are then compared to the annual-mean air \textendash{} sea density transformation over the Nordic Seas. The calculations suggest that the mean flow overturning may explain up to 25\% of the observed air \textendash{} sea transformation in the Lofoten-Norwegian Sea basins. But, over all, eddy-induced overturning must dominate the transport of buoyancy and heat into these interior regions, and the eddy parameterization used here is able to explain most of the density transformation rates. The calculations generally support previous claims that small-scale mixing is of secondary importance in high-latitude regions such as this, but they also open for the existence of a deep mixing-driven overturning cell between the eastern and western parts of the Nordic Seas.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper presents a new parameterization for shear-driven, stratified, turbulent mixing that is pertinent to climate models, in particular the shear-driven mixing in overflows and the Equatorial Undercurrent. This parameterization satisfies a critical requirement for climate applications by being simple enough to be implemented implicitly and thereby allowing the parameterization to be used with time steps that are long compared to both the time scale on which the turbulence evolves and the time scale with which it alters the large-scale ocean state.             The mixing is expressed in terms of a turbulent diffusivity that is dependent on the shear forcing and a length scale that is the minimum of the width of the low Richardson number region (Ri = N{$\mkern1mu$}2/|uz|2, where N is the buoyancy frequency and |uz| is the vertical shear) and the buoyancy length scale over which the turbulence decays [Lb = Q1/2/N, where Q is the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)]. This also allows a decay of turbulence vertically away from the low Richardson number region over the buoyancy scale, a process that the results show is important for mixing across a jet. The diffusivity is determined by solving a vertically nonlocal steady-state TKE equation and a vertically elliptic equilibrium equation for the diffusivity itself.             High-resolution nonhydrostatic simulations of shear-driven stratified mixing are conducted in both a shear layer and a jet. The results of these simulations support the theory presented and are used, together with discussions of various limits and reviews of previous work, to constrain parameters.},

The mechanisms by which the deep-ocean circulation changed, however, are still poorly understood and represent a major challenge to the understanding of past and future climates. This study highlights the importance of the integrated buoyancy loss rate around Antarctica in modulating the abyssal circulation and stratification. Theoretical arguments and idealized numerical simulations suggest that enhanced buoyancy loss around Antarctica leads to a strong increase in the abyssal stratification, consistent with proxy observations for the last glacial maximum. Enhanced buoyancy loss moreover leads to a contraction of the middepth overturning cell and thus upward shift of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The abyssal overturning cell initially expands to fill the void. However, if the buoyancy loss rate further increases, the abyssal cell also contracts, leaving a ``dead zone'' with vanishing meridional flow at middepth.},

AABW thickness generally decreases from south to north, modulated by ocean bathymetry. Likewise, NADW thickness generally decreases from north to south in the Atlantic Ocean. NADW dominates below the thermocline of the Atlantic Ocean at least as far south as the subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic, with a lesser, but still significant, influence around the entire Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in the Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean. However, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, AABW dominates below the thermocline. In addition, measurable quantities of AABW reach into the abyssal North Atlantic on both sides of the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The census results suggest that AABW occupies roughly twice the volume of NADW in the three main oceans, and that AABW is in contact with roughly twice the area of the deep main ocean floor compared with NADW. However, these results are somewhat sensitive to choices of water masses, their values of seawater properties, and the weightings of the seawater properties used in the analysis.},

These estimates are made using temperature variances from closely spaced full-depth CTD profiles taken during hydrographic sections. The temperature data along each section are high passed laterally at a 500-km scale, and the resulting variances are averaged in 5\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 5\textdegree{} bins to assess temperature noise levels as a function of pressure and geographic location. A mean global decorrelation time scale of 62 days is estimated using temperature time series at 1800 dbar from Argo floats. The hypothetical Deep Argo array would be capable of resolving, at one standard error, local trends from {$<$}1 m \textdegree C decade-1 in the quiescent abyssal North Pacific to about 26 m \textdegree C decade-1 below 2000 dbar along 50\textdegree S in the energetic Southern Ocean. Larger decadal temperature trends have been reported previously in these regions using repeat hydrographic section data, but those very sparse data required substantial spatial averaging to obtain statistically significant results. Furthermore, the array would provide decadal global ocean heat content trend estimates from 2000 to 6000 dbar with a standard error of {$\pm$}3 TW, compared to a trend standard error of {$\pm$}17 TW from a previous analysis of repeat hydrographic data.},

The 4.4-year trend estimate shows warming at an average rate of 3 ({$\pm$}1) m\textdegree C/year from 5,000 to 5,600 dbar, in the near-homogeneous layer of cold, dense bottom water of Antarctic origin. These results suggest acceleration of previously reported long-term warming trends in the abyssal waters in this region. They also demonstrate the ability of Deep Argo to quantify changes in the deep ocean in near real-time over short periods with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Estimating the diapycnal mixing rate from standard CTD data by identifying overturning regions in the water column (the Thorpe-scale approach) provides good spatial and temporal coverage but is sometimes limited by instrument noise. This noise leads to spurious density inversions that are difficult to distinguish from real turbulent overturns. Previous efforts to eliminate noise may have overcorrected and hence underestimated the level of mixing. Here idealized density profiles are used to identify the magnitude and characteristics of overturning regions arising entirely from instrument noise, in order to establish a standard against which CTD data can be compared. The key nondimensional parameters are 1) the amplitude of the noise scaled by the density change over the section of profile considered, and 2) the number of data points in the section of profile. In some cases the product of these, which is equal to the amplitude of the noise scaled by the average density difference between consecutive measurements, is more useful than the second parameter. The probability distribution of ``run length,'' a useful diagnostic, varies significantly across this parameter space. Reasons for this are discussed, and it is shown that CTD data very rarely lie in a region of parameter space where comparison with the probability density function (PDF) of run lengths for a random uncorrelated series, or its rms value \oe 6, is appropriate. The distribution of Thorpe displacements arising entirely from instrument noise, as well as the Thorpe scale and the statistics of density inversions, is also discussed. Analysis of CTD data from the interfaces of the thermohaline staircase in the deep Canada Basin illustrates how the results can be applied in practice to help to distinguish between signal and noise in marginal regimes. Density inversions seen in these data are shown to be no different from those that would result from instrument noise.},

  abstract = {Flow of Lower Circumpolar Water and North Pacific Deep Water is described in the Pacific at 10*Nprimarily using a recent trans-Pacific CTD/O2 section. Water-mass properties are used to define boundaries at potential isotherms for these two water masses. In turn, zero-velocity surfaces are set at different potential isotherms in each ocean basin along 10\textdegree N, their selection guided by the water-mass properties and the thermal wind field. These surfaces are then applied to estimate transport for each of the water masses. Net transport of Lower Circumpolar Water is estimated at 5.8 x 106 m3s- l (positive northward) in the East Mariana Basin and 8.1 x 106 m3 s- 1 in the Central Pacific Basin, while a small flow of 0.4 x 106 m3 s- ! through the Yap Trench into the Philippines Basin is inferred. In the Northeast Pacific Basin a transport of - 4 . 7 x 106 m3 s-1 over the western flank of the East Pacific Rise is estimated. There is no Lower Circumpolar Water in the Guatemala Basin, thus the net transport of Lower Circumpolar Water across 10\textdegree N in the Pacific is estimated to be 9.6 x 106 m 3 s -I. A net transport of - 2 . 6 x 106 m3 s-I of North Pacific Deep Water is estimated across this latitude, with the most robust feature being a transport of - 3 . 6 x 106 m 3 s-I over the western flank of the East Pacific Rise in the Northeast Pacific Basin. Recent repeated hydrographic measurements in the Western Pacific are used to confirm the transport estimates for the two westernmost basins. Finally, small adjustments to the 10\textdegree Nflow field (changes within the uncertainties of the present calculations) are shown to result in a transport scheme that is consistent with previous studies at 24\textdegree N.},

  abstract = {The surface salinity in the North Atlantic controls the position of the sinking branch of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC); the North Atlantic has higher salinity, so deep-water formation occurs there rather than in the North Pacific. Here, it is shown that in a 3D primitive equation model of two basins of different widths connected by a reentrant channel, there is a preference for sinking in the narrow basin even under zonally uniform surface forcing. This preference is linked to the details of the velocity and salinity fields in the ``sinking'' basin. The southward western boundary current associated with the wind-driven subpolar gyre has higher velocity in the wide basin than in the narrow basin. It overwhelms the northward western boundary current associated with the MOC for wide-basin sinking, so freshwater is brought from the far north of the domain southward and forms a pool on the western boundary in the wide basin. The fresh pool suppresses local convection and spreads eastward, leading to low salinities in the north of the wide basin for widebasin sinking. This pool of freshwater is much less prominent in the narrow basin for narrow-basin sinking, where the northward MOC western boundary current overcomes the southward western boundary current associated with the wind-driven subpolar gyre, bringing salty water from lower latitudes northward and enabling deep-water mass formation.},

Such conditions are typical of the oscillating boundary layers on adiabatic abyssal slopes, sloped lake bathymetry and sloped coastal bathymetry in the absence of high-wavenumber internal waves, mean flows, far-field turbulence on larger scales, and resonant tidal-bathymetric interaction. We investigate the linear stability of the oscillating flow within non-dimensional parameter space typical of the M2 tide and hydraulically smooth, middle-latitude abyssal slopes through Floquet linear stability analysis. The flow dynamics depends on three non-dimensional variables: the Reynolds number for Stokes' second problem, the Prandtl number, and a frequency ratio that accounts for the resonance conditions (C, criticality) of the buoyant restoring force and the tidal forcing. The Floquet analysis results suggest that oscillating laminar boundary layers on adiabatic abyssal slopes are increasingly unstable as Reynolds number, criticality parameter and/or spanwise disturbance wavenumber are increased. We also show that the two-dimensional Floquet linear instability necessarily generates three-dimensional baroclinic vorticity, which suggests that the evolution of the gravitational instabilities may be nonlinear as t -{$>$} infinity.},

The deep-water characteristics at depths greater than approximately 2000 dbar at 1651W differ among three regions demarcated by the Hawaiian Ridge at around 241N and the Mendocino Fracture Zone at 371N: the southern region (10\textendash 241N), central region (24\textendash 371N), and northern region (north of 371N). Deep water at temperatures below 1.15 1C and depths greater than 4000 dbar is highly stratified in the southern region, weakly stratified in the central region, and largely uniform in the northern region. Among the three regions, near-bottom water immediately east of Clarion Passage in the southern region is coldest (yo0.90 1C), most saline (S434.70), highest in dissolved oxygen (O244.2 ml l\`A1), and lowest in silica (Sio135 mmol kg\`A1). These characteristics of the deep water reflect transport of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) due to a branch current south of the Wake\textendash Necker Ridge that is separated from the eastern branch current of the deep circulation immediately north of 101N in the Central Pacific Basin. The branch current south of the Wake\textendash Necker Ridge carries LCDW of yo1.05 1C with a volume transport of 3.7 Sv (1 Sv {$\frac{1}{4}$} 106 m3 s\`A1) into the Northeast Pacific Basin through Horizon and Clarion Passages, mainly through the latter (\$3.1 Sv). A small amount of the LCDW flows northward at the western boundary of the Northeast Pacific Basin, joins the branch of deep circulation from the Main Gap of the Emperor Seamounts Chain, and forms an eastward current along the Mendocino Fracture Zone with volume transport of nearly 1 Sv. If this volume transport is typical, a major portion of the LCDW (\$3 Sv) carried by the branch current south of the Wake\textendash Necker and Hawaiian Ridges may spread in the southern part of the Northeast Pacific Basin. In the northern region at 1651W, silica maxima are found near the bottom and at 2200 dbar; the minimum between the double maxima occurs at a depth of approximately 4000 dbar (y\$1.15 1C). The geostrophic current north of 391N in the upper deep layer between 1.15 and 2.2 1C, with reference to the 1.15 1C isotherm, has a westward volume transport of 1.6 Sv at 39\textendash 441300N, carrying silica-rich North Pacific Deep Water from the northeastern region of the Northeast Pacific Basin to the Northwest Pacific Basin.},

Here, data from two occupations of eight hydrographic sections are combined and used in a box inverse model to estimate isopycnal and diapycnal transports in the Southern Ocean. A mixed layer box allows diapycnal transports in the surface mixed layer to be estimated separately. Current velocity at 1000 dbar was constrained by the mean velocity field estimated from subsurface float drift data. The estimated isopycnal transports are largely consistent with past estimates and with outputs of three ocean general circulation models. The estimated subduction and upwelling at the base of the Southern Ocean mixed layer show that Upper Circumpolar Deep Water upwells [16 +/- 15 and 17 +/- 21 Sv (where 1 Sv 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) by different inversion methods] and evolves into heavier Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (5 +/- 13 and 6 +/- 18 Sv) and Bottom Water (8 +/- 9 and 8 +/- 13 Sv) or lighter Mode and Intermediate Waters (9 +/- 18 and 13 +/- 24 Sv). Meridional transport in the surface mixed layer is due to northward Ekman transport and mostly southward eddy transport. In seasonal ice-covered areas near Antarctica, a significant (14 +/- 14 Sv) southward transport was found. The southward eddy transport is largest north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and decreases poleward because of the poleward decrease in the eddy diffusivity. The interior diapycnal transports, which can be either upward (gaining buoyancy) or downward (gaining density), are comparable in magnitude to the horizontal diapycnal transports within the surface mixed layer.},

  abstract = {Full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth-oxygen profiler (CTDO2) data at low latitudes in the western North Pacific in winter 1999 were analyzed with water-mass analysis and geostrophic calculations. The result shows that the deep circulation carrying the Lower Circumpolar Water (LCPW) bifurcates into eastern and western branch currents after entering the Central Pacific Basin. LCPW colder than 0.98 C is carried by the eastern branch current, while warmer LCPW is carried mainly by the western branch current. The eastern branch current flows northward in the Central Pacific Basin, supplying water above 0.94 C through narrow gaps into an isolated deep valley in the Melanesian Basin, and then passes the Mid-Pacific Seamounts between 162 100E and 170 100E at 18 200N, not only through the Wake Island Passage but also through the western passages. Except near bottom, dissolved oxygen of LCPW decreases greatly in the northern Central Pacific Basin, probably by mixing with the North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW). The western branch current flows northwestward over the lower Solomon Rise in the Melanesian Basin and proceeds westward between 10 400N and 12 200N at 150 E in the East Mariana Basin with volume transport of 4.1 Sv (1 Sv=106 m3 s\`A1). The current turns north, west of 150 E, and bifurcates around 14 N, south of the Magellan Seamounts, where dissolved oxygen decreases sharply by mixing with NPDW. Half of the current turns east, crosses 150 E at 14\textendash 15 N, and proceeds northward primarily between 152 E and 156 E at 18 200N toward the Northwest Pacific Basin (2.1 Sv). The other half flows northward west of 150 E and passes 18 200N just east of the Mariana Trench (2.2 Sv). It is reversed by a block of topography, proceeds southward along the Mariana Trench, then detours around the south end of the trench, and proceeds eastward along the Caroline Seamounts to the Solomon Rise, partly flowing into the West Mariana and East Caroline Basins. A deep western boundary current at 2000\textendash 3000 m depth above LCPW (10.0 Sv) closes to the coast than the deep circulation. The major part of it (8.5 Sv) turns cyclonic around the upper Solomon Rise from the Melanesian Basin and proceeds along the southern boundary of the East Caroline Basin. Nearly half of it proceeds northward in the western East Caroline Basin, joins the current from the east, then passes the northern channel, and mostly enters the West Caroline Basin (4.6 Sv), while another half enters this basin from the southern side ({$>$}3.8 Sv). The remaining western boundary current (1.5 Sv) flows over the middle and lower Solomon Rise, proceeds westward, then is divided by the Caroline Seamounts into southern (0.9 Sv) and northern (0.5 Sv) branches. The southern branch current joins that from the south in the East Caroline Basin, as noted above.},

Simple estimates show that the heat content increased in the layer deeper than 4000 m over almost the entire Pacific Ocean. The increase in heat content below 3000 m was about 5\% of the ocean-wide increase. Heat content changes in the deep layer are not uniform and a vertical profile of heat content change has a minimum at a depth around 3000 m. The non-uniform distribution of heat content change in the mid- to bottom layer demonstrates the existence of overturn circulation and may indicate that this circulation is changing.},

  abstract = {The oceanic response to overflows is explored using a two-layer isopycnal model. Overflows enter the open ocean as dense gravity currents that flow along and down the continental slope. While descending the slope, overflows typically double their volume transport by entraining upper oceanic water. The upper oceanic layer must balance this loss of mass, and the resulting convergent flow produces significant vortex stretching. Overflows thus represent an intense and localized mass and vorticity forcing for the upper ocean. In this study, simulations show that the upper ocean responds to the overflow-induced forcing by establishing topographic NL plumes that are aligned more or less along isobaths and that have a transport that is typically a few times larger than that of the overflows. For the topographic NL plume driven by the Mediterranean overflow, the occurrence of eddies near Cape St. Vincent, Portugal, allows the topographic NL plume to flow across isobaths. The modeled topographic NL-plume circulation forms two transatlantic zonal jets that are analogous to the Azores Current and the Azores Countercurrent. In other cases (e.g., the Denmark Strait overflow), the same kind of circulation remains trapped along the western boundary and hence would not be readily detected.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Slowly evolving stratified flow over rough topography is subject to substantial drag due to internal motions, but often numerical simulations are carried out at resolutions where this ``wave'' drag must be parameterized. Here we highlight the importance of internal drag from topography with scales that cannot radiate internal waves, but may be highly nonlinear, and we propose a simple parameterization of this drag that has a minimum of fit parameters compared to existing schemes. The parameterization smoothly transitions from a quadratic drag law (                              ) for low               Nh               /               u               0               (linear wave dynamics) to a linear drag law (                              ) for high               Nh               /               u               0               flows (nonlinear blocking and hydraulic dynamics), where               N               is the stratification,               h               is the height of the topography, and               u               0               is the near-bottom velocity; the parameterization does not have a dependence on Coriolis frequency. Simulations carried out in a channel with synthetic bathymetry and steady body forcing indicate that this parameterization accurately predicts drag across a broad range of forcing parameters when the effect of reduced near-bottom mixing is taken into account by reducing the effective height of the topography. The parameterization is also tested in simulations of wind-driven channel flows that generate mesoscale eddy fields, a setup where the downstream transport is sensitive to the bottom drag parameterization and its effect on the eddies. In these simulations, the parameterization replicates the effect of rough bathymetry on the eddies. If extrapolated globally, the subinertial topographic scales can account for 2.7 TW of work done on the low-frequency circulation, an important sink that is redistributed to mixing in the open ocean.},

  abstract = {Results of numerical simulations of the flow of a non-rotating, inviscid, Boussinesq fluid over smooth two-dimensional obstacles are described. The fluid has finite depth and a rigid lid. Far upstream of the obstacle the horizontal velocity and buoyancy frequency are uniform. Comparisons with linear theory for small-amplitude obstacles are made and the long-time behaviour is compared with steady-state Long's model solutions. Comparisons with the time-dependent results of Baines (1979) are done. For Froude numbers between {$\frac{1}{2}$} and 1 the obstacle amplitude is varied in order to determine the amplitudes needed to initiate wave breaking. These results are compared with the predictions of Long's model and with the experimental results of Baines (1977) showing good agreement with the latter. It is found that wave breaking occurs for amplitudes significantly lower than Long's model predicts for a large range of Froude numbers. This is shown to be the result of the generation of large-amplitude lee waves with wavelengths longer than that of stationary lee waves, but not long enough to propagate upstream. The behaviour of these waves is coupled to the generation of both longer mode-one waves which do propagate upstream from the obstacle and to mode-two waves which propagate against the flow as they are advected downstream. It is also coupled to oscillations in the wave drag. The periods of the wave drag oscillations are compared to experimental results showing good agreement with cases for which oscillations have been observed. The behaviour of these large transient lee waves is compared with the theoretical results contained in Grimshaw \& Yi (1991), showing some similarities. As the Froude number approaches 0.5 the breaking behaviour is no longer due to these large waves, with the result that wave breaking occurs much later.},

  author = {{Lane-Serff}, G F and Woodward, M D},
  year = {2001},
  abstract = {Internal bores are a common feature of tidally modulated two-layer exchange \#ows through straits and over sills. Even where the forcing changes smoothly, the \#ow may adjust with sudden jumps in the position of the interface between the two layers. The resulting \#ow con"guration, with a hydraulically controlled exchange \#ow (at the sill) coupled with a propagating internal hydraulic jump (known as a bore), is investigated with mathematical models and laboratory experiments. The study concentrates on twodimensional \#ow in a rectangular channel with a sill. The parameters considered are the depth of the channel compared to the depth over the sill, the depth of the interface before the passage of the bore and the strength of the net \#ux through the channel.The theory is based on shallow water equations and hydraulic control theory and includes the e!ects of a steady net \#ow through the channel (driven, for example, by the tide). Once the depth of the channel is twice the depth over the sill, further changes in geometry have relatively little e!ect on the \#ow. The bore velocity and \#uxes are strongly a!ected by the strength of any net \#ow. The laboratory experiments model pure exchange \#ows (with no net \#ow) and give detailed information about the bores themselves. In many cases an undular bore is produced, with a well-de"ned wave train on the interface behind the front of the bore. The wavelengths and amplitudes of these internal waves are quanti"ed and a brief comparison with similar internal waves observed in the Strait of Gibraltar is presented. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Diapycnal mixing in large nontidal basins is often assumed to be related to the effect of near-inertial waves. While the role of near-inertial shear for the generation of shear instabilities in the stratified interior is relatively well understood, much less is known about the impact of near-inertial motions on boundary mixing processes in nontidal systems, mainly owing to the lack of appropriate observations. Here, an extensive data set is discussed, describing the variability of boundary mixing induced by near-inertial motions near the sloping topography of one of the main basins of the Baltic Sea. These data reveal the existence of a vigorously turbulent bottom boundary layer of a few meters thickness covering the entire slope region above and below the permanent halocline that constitutes the main obstacle for vertical transport in the Baltic Sea. Near-bottom turbulence was driven by the nearinertial shear in the frictional boundary layer rather than by breaking of near-inertial waves near critical slopes. Large regions of the bottom boundary layer remained strongly stratified, and therefore, different from the traditional view of inefficient boundary mixing, mixing efficiencies reached values typical for the ocean's interior.},

  abstract = {This is a theoretical and laboratory study of stationary internal hydraulic jumps. These jumps are rapid transitions between internally supercritical flow, generated by placing a sill on the bed of a horizontal rectangular channel, and internally subcritical flow, generated by installing a downstream contraction. This contraction generates an approximately uniform flow downstream of the jump; thus mimicking barotropically driven two-layer flows, as found in tidally driven flows over underwater sills, and flows over mountain ranges driven by large-scale pressure gradients. Upstream of the jump a train of Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz billows forms on the interface between the layers. Upper layer fluid is entrained into these billows, which are subsequently advected into the lower portion of the jump. These billows are broken down by the turbulence of the jump, and the entrained upper layer fluid is mixed with lower layer fluid. Downstream of the jump the upper layer remains homogeneous, the density step at the interface is weakened, the upper portion of the lower layer is approximately linearly stratified, and the lower portion of the lower layer is undisturbed. This altered density profile is the downstream conjugate state of the jump. When the contraction is narrowed the jump moves upstream and `drowns' part of the train of billows, reducing the amount of entrainment. Thus, while the jump is responsible for mixing fluid from the upper layer into the lower layer, it is the position of the jump relative to the upstream train of billows that determines the amount of entrainment.},

He breaks down running in terms that speak to everyone who has ever struggled to get out the door and go for a run: getting comfortable being uncomfortable, how to start small and stick with it, that walking is a completely legitimate running strategy, and devising your own definition of success. Filled with 75 charts and graphs that give readers a sensible way to think about running, I Hate Running and You Can Too breaks down the reality of the training miles versus race miles, how to stay motivated, and what to do when faced with setbacks. I Hate Running and You Can Too shows readers that you won't always like running (sometimes you'll even hate it), but if you just keep going, you might learn to love it too"-- Provided by publisher},

The main effect of the surface and mixed layer is to align the vertical structure of the waves forming vertically standing waves locally; this contrasts with the assumption of random alignment in the Garrett-Munk model. Model spectra and coherences are calculated for idealized buoyancy frequency profiles and compared with the Garrett-Munk model. Measurements in the upper 200 m from the Mixed Layer Dynamics Experiment in the northeast Pacific in 1983 are also compared with the model results. The most striking success of the model is predicting the observed high coherence and 180\textdegree{} phase difference across the mixed layer of horizontal velocity.},

  abstract = {Tidal mixing over a slope was explored using moored time series observations on Kaena Ridge extending northwest from Oahu, Hawaii, during the Survey component of the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME). A mooring was instrumented to sample the velocity and density field of the lower 500 m of the water column to look for indirect evidence of tidally induced mixing and was deployed on a slope in 1453-m water depth for 2 months beginning in November 2000. The semidiurnal barotropic tidal currents at this site have a significant cross-ridge component, favorable for exciting an internal tidal response. A largeamplitude response is expected, given that the slope of the topography (4.5\textdegree ) is nearly the same as the slope of the internal wave group velocity at semidiurnal frequency. Density overturns were inferred from temperature profiles measured every 2 min. The number and strength of the overturns are greater in the 200 m nearest the bottom, with overturns exceeding 24 m present at any depth nearly 10\% of the time. Estimates of turbulent dissipation rate ␧ were made for each overturn by associating the measured Thorpe scale with the Ozmidov scale. The average ␧ between 1300 and 1450 m for the entire experiment is about 10Ϫ8 m2 sϪ3, corresponding to an average K␳ of 10Ϫ3 m2 sϪ1. Both ␧ and K␳ decrease by about an order of magnitude by 1200 m. The occurrence of overturns and the magnitude of ␧ are both highly correlated with the tide: both with the spring\textendash neap cycle as well as the phase of the semidiurnal tide itself. Dissipation rate varies by at least an order of magnitude over the spring\textendash neap cycle. It appears that tidal frequency vertical shear within 200 m of the boundary leads to significant strain (vertical divergence). Most of the overturns occur during the few hours when the vertical strain is greatest. The buoyancy frequency N calculated from reordering these overturns is a factor of 3 lower than the background N. This is consistent with the following kinematic description: the internal tide first strains the mean density field, leading to regions of low N that subsequently overturn. Less regularly, overturns also occur when the internal tide strain has created relatively high stratification within 200 m of the bottom.},

To place Tarahumara running more appropriately into its larger social and functional contexts, we combined our own observations and ethnographic evidence with interviews of 10 elderly Tarahumara runners about running during hunting as well as during footraces. We detail how running played an integral role in persistence hunting, in which groups of hunters employed a variety of methods to chase animals on foot. Running during hunting, moreover, is linked to men's and women's footraces, and both kinds of running are considered powerful forms of prayer. Long-distance running is also related to endurance dances that have important spiritual dimensions. Although the Tarahumara do not train to run in any traditional Western sense, and not all of them are great runners, the Tarahumara, like many Native American peoples, consider running, along with other endurance-based activities, to be important social and spiritual pursuits.},

  abstract = {We provide an updated estimate of the annual-mean, seasonal cycle and low frequency variability of the transports and properties of the Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW) plume in the northwestern Weddell Sea. For this we used a densely-instrumented mooring array deployed across the continental slope between January 2017 and January 2019. We found that the annual-mean WSBW transport is 3.4 {$\pm$} 1.5 Sv, corresponding to a cross-section area of 35 km2 and a maximum thickness of 203 m. The annual mean transport-weighted properties of WSBW are -0.99 \textordmasculine C ({$\Theta$}), 34.803 g/kg (SA) and 28.44 kg/m3 ({$\gamma$}n). The WSBW is characterized by 3 bottom-intensified velocity cores, which display seasonal variations in flow speed and transport different varieties of WSBW. The seasonal peak of WSBW transport and density is reached in May (4.7 Sv, 28.443 kg m-3) while the minimum values are observed in February (2.8 Sv, 28.435 kg m-3). The coldest WSBW is found between March and May, and the warmest between August and October. The density decrease of WSBW observed in the austral autumn of 2018 can be explained by warmer ambient waters being entrained during the formation of WSBW. This was enabled by the weakening of the along-shore winds associated with a positive SAM index, reinforced by a La Ni\~na event in early 2018.

  abstract = {Abstract Low mode internal waves in the stratified ocean are partially generated by the wind field in the near-inertial range and important for interior mixing and for the oceanic energy pathways. Long-term observations of energy fluxes of internal waves are sparse. Here, we study the temporal variability of wind-generated low mode near-inertial internal waves inside an internal tide beam emanating from seamounts south of the Azores. We use 20 months of consecutive mooring observations to calculate the mode 1 and mode 2 near-inertial energy flux as well as the near-inertial kinetic and potential energy. The energy flux time series is not steady due to its intermittent forcing with modes 1 and 2 contributing in a similar way to the total. A peak in the energy flux time series that can be directly linked to a storm event allows us to split the time series into a background period and a storm event period. The relative contribution of mode 1 to mode 2 remains the same during a storm event and background period. This study provides new insights into the relative importance of single wind events for the near-inertial energy flux and the opportunity to quantify the impact of an isolated strong wind event compared to a calm, tide-dominated background state. Thus, an adequate representation of storm events in parameterizations used for mixing estimates by ocean general circulation models is needed, as they are potentially of similar importance as the internal tides.},

A set of high-resolution current profile measurements in combination with temperature-microstructure measurements were collected during a complete cycle of the internal oscillation (`seiching') in the BBL of Lake Alpnach, Switzerland. It was found that even a relatively long seiching period of 24 hours significantly changed the form of the near-bottom current profiles as well as the dynamics of the turbulent dissipation rate compared to the steady-state law-of-the-wall. A logarithmic fit to the measured current profiles starting at a distance of 0.5~m above the sediment led to inconsistent estimates of both friction velocity and roughness length. Moreover, a phase lag between the current and the turbulent dissipation of 1.5 hours and a persistent maximum in the current profile at a height of 2.5 to 3~m above the sediment were observed. The experimental findings were compared to the results of a k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence model and showed good agreement in general. Specifically, the inconsistent logarithmic fitting results and the observed phase lag were reproduced well by the model.},

These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A method is presented for calculating a complete, numerically closed, mechanical energy budget in a realistic simulation of circulation in a coastal\textendash estuarine domain. The budget is formulated in terms of the ``local'' available potential energy (APE; Holliday and McIntyre 1981). The APE may be split up into two parts based on whether a water parcel has been displaced up or down relative to its rest depth. This decomposition clearly shows the different APE signatures of coastal upwelling (particles displaced up by wind) and the estuary (particles displaced down by mixing). Because the definition of APE is local in almost the same sense that kinetic energy is, this study may form meaningful integrals of reservoir and budget terms even over regions that have open boundaries. However, the choice of volume to use for calculation of the rest state is not unique and may influence the results. Complete volume-integrated energy budgets over shelf and estuary volumes in a realistic model of the northeast Pacific and Salish Sea give a new way to quantify the state of these systems and the physical forces that influence that state. On the continental shelf, upwelling may be quantified using APE, which is found to have order-one seasonal variation with an increase due to winds and decrease due to mixing. In the Salish Sea estuarine system, the APE has much less seasonal variation, and the magnitude of the most important forcing terms would take over 7 months to fully drain this energy.},

The narrow Samoan Passage, first recognized by Reid8, is perhaps the most important channel with depth sufficient to allow a significant flow of bottom water from the southern basin into the central basin. Bottom current velocities in the passage of 5 to 15 cm s-1 towards the north have been measured9 and Nansen casts in the passage revealed a sharp decrease in temperature of 0.27\textdegree{} C in 150 m at a depth of about 4,400 m10. This benthic thermocline marks the abrupt boundary between the deep water and the ABW and supports the observation of cold bottom water flow through the passage. (In a personal communication, P.

Though observed mixing rates are on average consistent with values required by inverse models, recent attention has focused on the dramatic spatial variability, spanning several orders of magnitude, of mixing rates in both the upper and deep ocean. Away from ocean boundaries, the spatiotemporal patterns of mixing are largely driven by the geography of generation, propagation, and dissipation of internal waves, which supply much of the power for turbulent mixing. Over the last 5 years and under the auspices of U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR), a National Science Foundation (NSF)- and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-supported Climate Process Team has been engaged in developing, implementing, and testing dynamics-based parameterizations for internal wave\textendash driven turbulent mixing in global ocean models. The work has primarily focused on turbulence 1) near sites of internal tide generation, 2) in the upper ocean related to wind-generated near inertial motions, 3) due to internal lee waves generated by low-frequency mesoscale flows over topography, and 4) at ocean margins.

Since 1999, an array of bottom-mounted acoustic instruments measuring current velocity and bottom-to-surface acoustic travel times was deployed at the sill. Here, the optimization of the array configuration based on a numerical overflow model is discussed. The simulation proves that more than 80\% of the dense water transport variability is captured by two to three acoustic current profilers (ADCPs). The results are compared with time series from ADCPs and Inverted Echo Sounders deployed from 1999 to 2003, confirming that the dense overflow plume can be reliably measured by bottom-mounted instruments and that the overflow is largely geostrophically balanced at the sill.},

Although the coldest waters that appear at the bottom in each of the oceans have long been known to have come from the Southern Ocean, the characteristics indicate that the major component of the abyssal waters of the World Ocean does not derive directly from the abyssal Antarctic but from the shallower Circumpolar Water (CPW). The CPW is a mixture of Antarctic waters with the warm, saline, oxygen-rich, and nutrient-poor deep waters from the North Atlantic. As the CPW extends northward it is modified by mixing with the overlying waters, which in the North Atlantic and North Indian oceans are more saline and in the North Pacific less saline. Except for the Antarctic area, the northern North Atlantic Ocean is the major source of oxygen to the deep-ocean waters. The abyssal waters of the Northeast Pacific are farthest from regions of ventilation and are the most nearly uniform and may be the oldest of the abyssal waters.},

The model is perfectly adiabatic and spans the Equator and thus fills a gap between quasi-geostrophic models, which cannot span two hemispheres, and idealized general circulation models, which generally include diabatic processes and buoyancy forcing. We show that the model solution is approaching convergence in mean kinetic energy for the ocean mesoscale processes of interest and has a rich range of dynamics with circulation features that emerge only due to resolving mesoscale turbulence.},

The density and current structure of the upper ocean at the Hawaiian Ridge were observed using SeaSoar and Doppler sonar during a survey extending from Oahu to Brooks Banks and up to 200 km from the ridge peak. Survey observations are used to quantify spatial changes in internal-wave-induced turbulent dissipation and mixing. The turbulent dissipation rate of kinetic energy ␧ and diapycnal eddy diffusivity K␳ are inferred from an established parameterization using internal wave shear as input. At the Kauai Channel (KC) and French Frigate Shoals/Brooks Banks sites, ␧ and K␳ decay away from the ridge with maxima exceeding minima by 5 times. At both sites, average K␳ is everywhere greater than the canonical open-ocean value of 10Ϫ5 m2 sϪ1. Along the ridge, ␧ and K␳ vary by up to 100 times and are largest at sites of largest numerical model internal tide energy density. In the eastern KC, K␳ Ͼ 10Ϫ3 m2 sϪ1 is typical in a patch more than 200 m thick located above the path of an M2 internal tide ray. An upper limit on the dissipation rate from M2 internal tides to turbulence within 50 km of the Hawaiian Ridge is roughly estimated to be in the range of 4\textendash 9 GW. At KC, the depth-integrated internal wave energy density and dissipation rate are positively correlated. Potential density inversions occur near the main ridge axis at significant topographic features. Average K␳ is larger inside inversions.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing plays a major role in enabling the large-scale ocean circulation. The accuracy of mixing rates estimated from observations depends on our understanding of basic fluid mechanical processes underlying the nature of turbulence in a stratified fluid. Several of the key assumptions made in conventional mixing parameterizations have been increasingly scrutinized in recent years, primarily on the basis of adequately high resolution numerical simulations. We add to this evidence by compiling results from a suite of numerical simulations of the turbulence generated through stratified shear instability processes. We study the inherently intermittent and time-dependent nature of wave-induced turbulent life cycles and more specifically the tight coupling between inherently anisotropic scales upon which small-scale isotropic turbulence grows. The anisotropic scales stir and stretch fluid filaments enhancing irreversible diffusive mixing at smaller scales. We show that the characteristics of turbulent mixing depend on the relative time evolution of the Ozmidov length scale                                                                      \$L\_\{O\}\$                                               compared to the so-called Thorpe overturning scale                                                                      \$L\_\{T\}\$                                               which represents the scale containing available potential energy upon which turbulence feeds and grows. We find that when                                                                      \$L\_\{T\}\textbackslash sim L\_\{O\}\$                                               , the mixing is most active and efficient since stirring by the largest overturns becomes `optimal' in the sense that it is not suppressed by ambient stratification. We argue that the high mixing efficiency associated with this phase, along with observations of                                                                      \$L\_\{O\}/L\_\{T\}\textbackslash sim 1\$                                               in oceanic turbulent patches, together point to the potential for systematically underestimating mixing in the ocean if the role of overturns is neglected. This neglect, arising through the assumption of a clear separation of scales between the background mean flow and small-scale quasi-isotropic turbulence, leads to the exclusion of an highly efficient mixing phase from conventional parameterizations of the vertical transport of density. Such an exclusion may well be significant if the mechanism of shear-induced turbulence is assumed to be representative of at least some turbulent events in the ocean. While our results are based upon simulations of shear instability, we show that they are potentially more generic by making direct comparisons with                                                                      \$L\_\{T\}-L\_\{O\}\$                                               data from ocean and lake observations which represent a much wider range of turbulence-inducing physical processes.},

Recent observational evidence suggests, however, that there could be a mismatch between the observed intensity of mixing integrated over basin or global scales, and the net mixing required to sustain the overturning's deep upwelling limb.  Here, we investigate the hitherto largely overlooked role of tens of thousands of seamounts in resolving this discrepancy. Dynamical theory indicates that seamounts may stir and mix deep waters by generating lee waves and topographic wake vortices. At low latitudes, this is enhanced by a layered vortex regime in the wakes. We consider three case studies (in the equatorial zone, Southern Ocean and Gulf Stream) that are predicted by theory to be representative of, respectively, a layered vortex, barotropic wake, and hybrid regimes, and corroborate theoretical scalings of mixing in each case with a realistic regional ocean model. We then apply such scalings to a global seamount dataset and an ocean climatology to show that seamount-generated mixing makes a leading-order contribution to the global upwelling of deep waters. Our work thus brings seamounts to the fore of the deep-ocean mixing problem, and urges observational, theoretical and modeling efforts toward incorporating the seamounts' mixing effects in conceptual and numerical models of the ocean circulation.},

There has been significant progress in the fluid mechanical understanding of the physics of breaking internal waves. Connection of the microphysics of such turbulence to the larger scale dynamics, however, is significantly underdeveloped. We offer a hybrid theoretical\textendash statistical approach, informed by observations, to make such a link. By doing so, we define a bulk flux coefficient,                                                                      \$\textbackslash varGamma \_B\$                                               , which represents the partitioning of energy available to an `ocean box' (such as a grid cell of a coarse resolution climate model), from winds, tides, and other sources, into mixing and dissipation.

By applying our approach to climatology and global tidal estimates, we show that, on a basin scale, energetic mixing zones exhibit moderately efficient mixing that induces significant vertical density fluxes, while quiet zones (with small background turbulence levels), although highly efficient in mixing, exhibit minimal vertical fluxes. The transition between the less energetic to more energetic zones marks regions of intense upwelling and downwelling of deep waters. We suggest that such upwelling and downwelling may be stronger than previously estimated, which in turn has direct implications for the closure of the deep branch of the ocean meridional overturning circulation as well as for the associated tracer budgets.},

While the classic marginal shear instability of Richardson number similar to 1/4 has been considered as potentially relevant to turbulent wave breaking, its relevance to flows that are not steady parallel shear flows has been suspect. We show that shear instability is indeed relevant in the ocean interior and propose a new marginal stability paradigm that relates the stability criterion based on Richardson number to one based on the ratio of Ozmidov and Thorpe turbulence scales. The new paradigm applies to both ocean interior and boundary layer flows. This allows for accurate quantification of the transition from downwelling to upwelling zones in a recently emerged paradigm of ocean circulation.

These form stresses combine to help set the strength and structure of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC), a key nexus of heat and gas exchange between the deep ocean and the atmosphere. For the first time in a general circulation model, we calculate the timevarying, three-dimensional IFS field directly from zonal pressure gradients across vertical perturbations in isopycnal layer interfaces. We confirm previous findings that IFS compensates wind stress at the surface and topographic form stress at the seafloor in the Drake Passage latitudes. We find that zonal and time-mean IFS is primarily responsible for this surface wind stress compensation, with some contribution from transient eddy IFS. Mean, standing eddy, and transient eddy IFS combine to compensate topographic form stress at depth. Both standing and transient eddy IFS concentrate at stationary meanders along the ACC, and transient eddy IFS dominates standing eddy IFS in regions of high eddy kinetic energy. Finally, total IFS changes sign from balancing eastward wind stress to balancing westward topographic form stress around 28.1 kg m23, close to the upper limit of Antarctic Bottom Water, indicating the role of buoyancy forcing in setting the structure of the IFS field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ocean lee waves occur on length scales that are smaller than the grid scale of global circulation models (GCMs). Therefore, such models must parameterize the drag associated with launching lee waves. This paper compares the lee wave drag predicted by existing parameterizations with the drag measured in high-resolution nonhydrostatic numerical simulations of a lee wave over periodic sinusoidal bathymetry. The simulations afford a time-varying glimpse at the nonlinear and nonhydrostatic oceanic lee wave spinup process and identify a characteristic time scale to reach steady state. The maximum instantaneous lee wave drag observed during the spinup period is found to be well predicted by linear lee wave theory for all hill heights. In steady state, the simulations demonstrate the applicability of parameterizing the drag based on applying linear theory to the lowest overtopping streamline of the flow (LOTS), as is currently employed in GCMs. However, because existing parameterizations are based only on the height of the LOTS, they implicitly assume hydrostatic flow. For hills tall enough to trap water in their valleys, the simulations identify a set of nonhydrostatic processes that can result in a reduction of the lee wave drag from that given by hydrostatic parameterizations. The simulations suggest implementing a time-dependent nonhydrostatic version of the LOTS-based parameterization of lee wave drag and demonstrate the remarkable applicability of linear lee wave theory to oceanic lee waves.},

  abstract = {The circulation and transport of Antarctic Bottom Water ({$\sigma$}4{$<$}45.87) in the region of the Vema Channel are studied along three WOCE hydrographic lines, the geostrophic velocities referenced to previously published direct current measurements. The primary supply of water to the deep Vema Channel is from the Argentine Basin's deep western boundary current, with no indication of an inflow from the southeast. In the northern Argentine Basin, detachment of lower North Atlantic Deep Water from the continental slope is associated with a deep thermohaline front near 34\textdegree S. To the north of this front, the upper part of the AABW bound for the Vema Channel ({$\sigma$}4{$<$}46.01) exhibits a significant NADW influence. Further modification of the throughflow water occurs near 30\textdegree 30{${'}$}S, where the channel orientation changes by {$\sim$}50\textdegree. Southward flow of bottom water on the eastern flank of the Vema Channel, amounting to {$\sim$}1.5Sv, represents a significant countercurrent to the deep channel transport. Inclusion of this countercurrent reduces the net flow of AABW through the Vema Channel from 3.2{$\pm$}0.7 to 1.7{$\pm$}1.1Sv. Water properties imply that the near-zero net flow over the Santos Plateau results from a near-closed cyclonic circulation fed by the deep Vema Channel throughflow. A disruption of the northward boundary current in the upper AABW (lower circumpolar water) is required by this flow pattern. The extension of the cyclonic circulation on the Santos Plateau enters the Brazil Basin as a {$\sim$}1Sv flow distinct from the outflow in the Vema Channel Extension (6.2Sv). The high magnitude of the latter suggests a southward recirculation of bottom water near the western boundary to the north of the region of study.},

  abstract = {Using inverse methods a circulation for a new section along 32\textdegree S in the Indian Ocean is derived with a maximum in the overturning stream function (or deep overturning) of 10.3 Sv at 3310 m. Shipboard and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data are used to inform the choice of reference level velocity for the initial geostrophic field. Our preferred solution includes a silicate constraint (\`A312 {$\pm$} 380 kmol s\`A1) consistent with an Indonesian throughflow of 12 Sv. The overturning changes from 12.3 Sv at 3270 m when the silicate constraint is omitted to 10.3 Sv when it is included. The deep overturning varies by only {$\pm$}0.7 Sv as the silicate constraint varies from +68 to \`A692 kmol s\`A1, and by {$\pm$}0.3 Sv as the net flux across the section, driven by the Indonesian throughflow, varies from \`A7 to \`A17 Sv with an appropriately scaled silicate flux constraint. Thus, the overturning is insensitive to the size of the Indonesian throughflow and silicate constraint within their apriori uncertainties. We find that the use of the ADCP data adds significant detail to the horizontal circulation. These resolved circulations include the Agulhas Undercurrent, deep cyclonic gyres and deep fronts, features evidenced by long term integrators of the flow such as current meter and float measurements as well as water properties.},

  abstract = {Abstract The influence of terrain asymmetry on the development and strength of downslope windstorms was examined through the numerical simulation of three basic atmospheric configurations: 1) flow beneath a mean-state critical layer, 2) flow in the presence of breaking waves and 3) flow in a two-layer atmosphere without wave breaking or a mean-state critical layer. When a mean-state critical layer was present in the flow and the wind speed and stability beneath that critical layer were essentially constant, the maximum downslope wind speed was nearly independent of mountain asymmetry. Such insensitivity to mountain shape is consistent with hydraulic theory and supports the idea that there is a close mathematical analog between stratified flow beneath a mean-state critical layer and conventional shallow-water hydraulic theory. When downslope winds were generated by breaking waves, and the upstream stability and wind speed were constant with height, the dependence of lee-slope velocities on terrain asymmetry remained weak. When downslope winds were produced in a two-layer atmosphere without wave breaking or a mean-state critical layer, the flow exhibited a noticeable, but not dominating, sensitivity to mountain asymmetry. The preceding results were obtained from simulations without surface friction. When a surface friction parameterization was included in the numerical model, the sensitivity of the downslope wind speed to mountain asymmetry was significantly enhanced. It appears that in the surface friction simulations, the most significant shape parameter is not mountain asymmetry per se, but simply the steepness of the lee slope, with steep lee slopes being most favorable for strong winds.},

  abstract = {One of the major objectives of the Deep Basin Experiment, a component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, was to quantify the intensity and spatial distribution of deep vertical mixing within the Brazil Basin. In this study, basin-averaged estimates of deep vertical mixing rates are calculated using two independent methodologies and datasets: 1) vertical fluxes are derived from large-scale temperature and density budgets using direct measurements of deep flow through passages connecting the Brazil Basin to surrounding basins and a comprehensive hydrographic dataset within the basin interior and 2) vertical mixing rates are estimated from finescale bathymetry and hydrographic data using a functional relationship between turbulent dissipation and bathymetric roughness, deduced from localized measurements of ocean microstructure obtained during the Deep Basin Experiment. The space\textendash time mean estimates of vertical mixing diffusivities across representative surfaces within the Antarctic Bottom Water layer fell in the range ␬ ϳ 1\textendash 5(ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1) and were indistinguishable from each other within the estimation uncertainties. The mixing rates inferred from potential temperature budgets update, and are consistent with, earlier estimates that were based on less data. Mixing rates inferred from budgets bounded by neutral surfaces are not significantly different from the former. This implies that lateral eddy fluxes along isopycnals are not important in the potential temperature budgets, at least within the large estimation uncertainties. Unresolved processes, such as cabbeling and low frequency variability, which complicate inference of mixing from large-scale budgets, have been considered. The agreement between diffusivity estimates based on a modeled relationship between bathymetric roughness and turbulent dissipation, with those inferred from large-scale budgets, provides independent confirmation that the mixing rates have been accurately quantified.},

Over a submarine landslide perpendicular to the continental slope, enhanced mixing extended at least 600 m above the boundary, increasing toward the bottom.

Recent literature suggests that spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves by frontal instabilities could represent a major sink for the subinertial quasigeostrophic circulation. An unforced three-dimensional 1-km-resolution model, initialized with the observed cross-Kuroshio structure, is used to explore this mechanism. After several weeks, the model exhibits growth of 10\textendash 100-km-scale frontal meanders, accompanied by               O               (10) mW m               -2               spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves associated with readjustment of submesoscale fronts forced out of balance by mesoscale confluent flows. These waves have properties resembling those in the observations. However, they are reabsorbed into the model Kuroshio Front with no more than 15\% dissipating or radiating away. Thus, spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves represents a redistribution of quasigeostrophic energy rather than a significant sink.},

  abstract = {The impact of mean-flow variability on finite-amplitude trapped mountain lee waves is investigated by conducting two-dimensional mountain wave simulations for a set of idealized, time-dependent background flows. The lee-wave patterns generated by these time-dependent flows depend on two factors: 1) the degree to which the transition in the background flow changes the amplitude of the stationary trapped lee wave and 2) the difference between the group velocities of the trapped waves generated before and after the transition. When the transition in the background flow significantly reduces the amplitude of the stationary lee wave, the leewave pattern generated prior to the transition gradually drifts downstream away from the mountain or back over the mountain, depending on the sign of this wave packet's group velocity after the transition. When the transition in the background flow changes the resonant wavelength while leaving the lee-wave amplitude relatively unchanged, the lee-wave train develops either 1) a smooth transition in horizontal wavelength or 2) a region of irregular variations in wavelength and amplitude, depending on the difference between the group velocities of the waves generated before and after the transition. Although linear theory is able to predict how changes in the background flow will affect the group velocities of the trapped waves, it is not able to predict whether the temporal variations in the large-scale environmental flow will amplify or dampen the resonant waves when the waves are no longer linear.},

For moderate amplitudes, a nonlinear wave interaction involving the stationary trapped wave and a pair of nonstationary waves appears to be responsible for the development of nonstationary perturbations on the stationary trapped wave. This pair of nonstationary waves consists of a trapped wave and a vertically propagating wave, both having horizontal wavelengths approximately twice that of the stationary trapped wave. As the flow becomes more nonlinear, the nonstationary perturbations involve a wider spectrum of horizontal wavelengths and may dominate the overall wave pattern at wave amplitudes significantly below the threshold required to produce wave breaking. Sensitivity tests in which the wave propagation characteristics of the basic state are modified without changing the horizontal wavelength of the stationary trapped wave indicate these nonstationary perturbations are absent when the background flow does not support nonstationary trapped waves with horizontal wavelengths approximately twice that of the stationary trapped mode. These sensitivity tests also show that a second nonstationary trapped wave can assume the role of the nonstationary vertically propagating wave when the Scorer parameter in the upper layer is reduced below the threshold that will support the vertically propagating wave. In this case, a resonant triad composed of three trapped waves appears to be responsible for the development of nonstationary perturbations.},

  abstract = {Antarctica is often associated with images of masculine figures battling against the blizzard. The pervasiveness of heroic white masculine leadership and exploration in Antarctica and, more broadly, in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) research cultures, has meant women have had lesser access to Antarctic research and fieldwork opportunities, with a marked increase since the 1980s. This article presents findings from an exploratory online survey examining how 95 women experienced research and remote Antarctic fieldwork with the Australian Antarctic Program. Although women are entering polar science in greater numbers, a key theme of the qualitative findings of this survey is that gendered barriers to participation in research and fieldwork persist. We discuss five key gendered barriers including: 1) Physical barriers, 2) Caring responsibilities/unpaid work, 3) Cultural sexism/gender bias, 4) Lack of opportunities/recognition, and 5) Unwanted male attention/sexual harassment. We argue that the lack of attention paid to gender and sexuality in polar fieldwork contributes to the invisibility and exclusion of women and other marginalized identities broadly. To conclude, we point to the importance of targeted inclusivity, diversity and equity initiatives through Antarctic research globally and specifically by National Antarctic Programs.},

  abstract = {Abstract An inverse box model of the Scotia Sea is constructed using hydrographic, tracer, and velocity data collected along the rim of the basin during the Antarctic Large-Scale Box Analysis and the Role of the Scotia Sea (ALBATROSS) cruise. The model provides an estimate of the time-mean three-dimensional circulation as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) crosses the region. It concurrently solves for geostrophic and wind-driven Ekman transports across the boundaries of the basin, air\textendash sea-driven diapycnal fluxes, and ``interior'' diapycnal fluxes below the ocean surface. An increase is diagnosed in the ACC volume transport from 143 {$\pm$} 13 Sv (Sv {$\equiv$} 106 m3 s-1) at Drake Passage to 149 {$\pm$} 16 Sv on leaving the Scotia Sea, supplied by the import of 5.9 {$\pm$} 1.7 Sv of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) over the South Scotia Ridge. There is a lateral redistribution of the transport, primarily in response to a topographically induced branching of the 70\textendash 80 Sv polar front (PF) jet and an increase in the transport associated with the subantarctic front (SAF) from 31 {$\pm$} 7 to 48 {$\pm$} 4 Sv. A vertical rearrangement of the transport also occurs, with differences O(2 Sv) in the transports of intermediate and deep water masses. These volume transport changes are accompanied by a net reduction (increase) in the heat (freshwater) flux associated with the ACC by 0.02 {$\pm$} 0.020 PW (0.020 {$\pm$} 0.017 Sv), the main cause of which is the cooling and freshening of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) layer in the Scotia Sea. The model suggests that the Scotia Sea hosts intense diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior extending 1500\textendash 2000 m above the rough topography of the basin. Despite these model results, no evidence is found for a significant diapycnal link between the upper and lower classes of CDW (and hence between the ``shallow'' and ``deep'' cells of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation). On the contrary, the boundary between Upper and Lower CDW separates two distinct regimes of diapycnal mixing involving volume fluxes of 1\textendash 3 Sv. Whereas in the denser waters topographic mixing is important, in lighter layers air\textendash sea-driven diapycnal volume fluxes are dominant and diapycnal transfers of heat and freshwater are mainly effected by upper-ocean mixing processes. The model indicates that the ventilation of the deep ACC in the Scotia Sea is driven primarily by isopycnal exchanges with the northern Weddell Sea and to a lesser extent by diapycnal mixing with WSDW. The model reveals the existence of a mesoscale eddy-driven overturning circulation across the ACC core involving an isopycnal poleward transport of 8 {$\pm$} 1 Sv of CDW and an equatorward transport of intermediate water of the same magnitude. This circulation induces a cross-ACC poleward heat flux of 0.022 {$\pm$} 0.009 PW and an equatorward freshwater flux of 0.02 {$\pm$} 0.01 Sv. Adequately scaled, the former compares favorably to measurements of the cross-stream eddy heat flux by moored current meters and floats in the ACC and to budget estimates of the circumpolar cross-ACC heat flux.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A simple theoretical model of the deep stratification and meridional overturning circulation in an idealized single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing; predicts the deep stratification in terms of the surface forcing and other problem parameters; makes no assumption of zero residual circulation; and consistently accounts for the interaction between the circumpolar channel and the rest of the ocean.             The theory shows that dynamics of the overturning circulation can be characterized by two limiting regimes, corresponding to weak and strong diapycnal mixing. The transition between the two regimes is described by a nondimensional number characterizing the strength of the diffusion-driven compared to the wind-driven overturning circulation. In the limit of weak diapycnal mixing, deep stratification throughout the ocean is produced by the effects of wind and eddies in a circumpolar channel and maintained even in the limit of vanishing diapycnal diffusivity and in a flat-bottomed ocean. The overturning circulation across the deep stratification is driven by the diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel but is sensitive, through changes in stratification, to the wind and eddies in the channel. In the limit of strong diapycnal mixing, deep stratification is primarily set by eddies in the channel and diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel, with the wind over the circumpolar channel playing a secondary role. Analytical solutions for the deep stratification and overturning circulation in the limit of weak diapycnal mixing and numerical solutions that span the regimes of weak to strong diapycnal mixing are presented.             The theory is tested with a coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model configured in an idealized geometry. A series of experiments performed to examine the sensitivity of the deep stratification and the overturning circulation to variations in wind stress and diapycnal mixing compare well with predictions from the theory.},

The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing and predicts the deep stratification and overturning streamfunction in terms of the surface forcing and other parameters of the problem. It relies on a matching among three regions: the circumpolar channel at high southern latitudes, a region of isopycnal outcrop at high northern latitudes, and the ocean basin between.             The theory describes both the middepth and abyssal cells of a circulation representing North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. It suggests that, although the strength of the middepth overturning cell is primarily set by the wind stress in the circumpolar channel, middepth stratification results from a balance between the wind-driven upwelling in the channel and deep-water formation at high northern latitudes. Diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior can lead to warming and upwelling of deep waters. However, for parameters most representative of the present ocean mixing seems to play a minor role for the middepth cell. In contrast, the abyssal cell is intrinsically diabatic and controlled by a balance between the deep mixing-driven upwelling and the residual of the wind-driven and eddy-induced circulations in the Southern Ocean.             The theory makes explicit predictions about how the stratification and overturning circulation vary with the wind strength, diapycnal diffusivity, and mesoscale eddy effects. The predictions compare well with numerical results from a coarse-resolution general circulation model.},

  abstract = {Vertical mixing in the ocean is a key driver of the global ocean thermohaline circulation, one of the most important factors controlling past and future climate change. Prior observational and theoretical studies have focused on intense tidal mixing near the sea bottom (near-field mixing). However, ocean general circulation models that employ a parameterization of near-field mixing significantly underestimate the strength of the Pacific thermohaline circulation. Here we demonstrate that tidally induced mixing away from the sea bottom (far-field mixing) is essential in controlling the Pacific thermohaline circulation. Via the addition of far-field mixing to a widely used tidal parameterization, we successfully simulate the Pacific thermohaline circulation. We also propose that far-field mixing is indispensable for explaining the presence of the world ocean's oldest water in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Our findings suggest that far-field mixing controls ventilation of the deep Pacific Ocean, a process important for ocean carbon and biogeochemical cycles.},

A novel concept parameterizing internal wave\textendash mean flow interaction in ocean circulation models is demonstrated, based on the description of the entire wave field by the wave-energy density in physical and wavenumber space and its prognostic computation by the radiative transfer equation. The concept enables a simplification of the radiative transfer equation with a small number of reasonable assumptions and a derivation of simple but consistent parameterizations in terms of spectrally integrated energy compartments that are used as prognostic model variables. The effect of the waves on the mean flow in this paradigm is in accordance with the nonacceleration theorem: only in the presence of dissipation do waves globally exchange energy with the mean flow in the time mean. The exchange can have either direction. These basic features of wave\textendash mean flow interaction are theoretically derived in a Wentzel\textendash Kramers\textendash Brillouin (WKB) approximation of the wave dynamics and confirmed in a suite of numerical experiments with unidirectional shear flow.}

Globally constant parameters in the tidally induced mixing schemes along with other physical parameters are optimally estimated based on the Green's function method. The optimized model performs reasonably well in reproducing the deep-water properties of the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that the combination of tidally induced vertical-mixing schemes is useful in providing a reliable simulation of the deep-ocean state, consistent with both observed broad-scale hydrographic characteristics and recent knowledge of mixing. Adjustment of the parameters in the near-field mixing scheme was effective in improving simulation of the deep-ocean state. These results suggest that the adjustment of a small number of globally constant parameters in tidally induced and other mixing schemes based on recent knowledge of mixing through data assimilation may enable improvements in ocean state estimation throughout the entire water column, including the deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Despite slow rates of ocean mixing, observational and modeling studies suggest that buoyancy is redistributed to all depths of the ocean on surprisingly short interannual to decadal time scales. The mechanisms responsible for this redistribution remain poorly understood. This work uses an Earth system model to evaluate the global steady-state ocean buoyancy (and related steric sea level) budget, its interannual variability, and its transient response to a doubling of CO2 over 70 years, with a focus on the deep ocean. At steady state, the simple view of vertical advective\textendash diffusive balance for the deep ocean holds at low to midlatitudes. At higher latitudes, the balance depends on a myriad of additional terms, namely mesoscale and submesoscale advection, convection and overflows from marginal seas, and terms related to the nonlinear equation of state. These high-latitude processes rapidly communicate anomalies in surface buoyancy forcing to the deep ocean locally; the deep, high-latitude changes then influence the large-scale advection of buoyancy to create transient deep buoyancy anomalies at lower latitudes. Following a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the high-latitude buoyancy sinks are suppressed by a slowdown in convection and reduced dense water formation. This change is accompanied by a slowing of both upper and lower cells of the global meridional overturning circulation, reducing the supply of dense water to low latitudes beneath the pycnocline and the commensurate flow of light waters to high latitudes above the pycnocline. By this mechanism, changes in high-latitude buoyancy are communicated to the global deep ocean on relatively fast advective time scales.},

It regulates the exchange of water across the shelf break and provides a path for interbasin westward transport. Despite its significance, the ASC remains largely unobserved around most of the Antarctic continent. Here we present direct velocity observations from a 17 month current meter moored array deployed across the continental slope between the 1000 and the 4200 m isobaths, in the southeastern Indian Ocean near 1138E. The observed time-mean flow consists of a surface-intensified jet associated with the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and a broader bottom-intensified westward flow that extends out to approximately the 4000 m isobath and is strongest along the upper slope. The time-mean transport of the ASC is 229.2 Sv. Fluctuations in the transport are large, typically exceeding the mean by a factor of 2. They are mainly due to changes in the northward extent of the current over the lower slope. However, seasonal changes in the wind also drive variations in the transport of the ASF and the flow in the upper slope. Both mean and variability are largely barotropic, thus invisible to traditional geostrophic methods.},

The 130-km-long ``Northern Channel'' (NC) is topographically confined and is typically only 5 km wide. In it, the Red Sea plume shows unanticipated patterns of vertical structure, turbulent mixing, and entrainment. Above the seafloor a 25\textendash 120-m-thick weakly stratified layer shows little dilution along the channel. Hence this bottom layer undergoes only weak entrainment. In contrast, a 35\textendash 285-m-thick interfacial layer shows stronger entrainment and is shown in a companion paper to undergo vigorous turbulent mixing. It is thus the interface that exhibits the bulk of entrainment of the Red Sea plume in the NC. The interfacial layer also carries most of the overall plume transport, increasingly so with downstream distance. The ``Southern Channel'' (SC) is wider than the NC and is accessed from the latter by a sill about 33 m above the floor of the NC. Entrainment into the bottom layer of the SC is diagnosed to be strong near the entry into the SC such that the near-bottom density and salinity are smaller in the SC than in the NC at the same distance from Bab el Mandeb. In comparison with winter conditions, the authors encountered weaker outflow with shallower equilibration depths during the summer cruise. Bulk Froude numbers computed for the whole plume varied within the range 0.2\textendash 1. Local maxima occurred in relatively steep channel sections and coincided with locations of significant entrainment.},

In the NC, the Red Sea plume simultaneously exhibited weak entrainment into a 35\textendash 120m-thick, weakly stratified bottom layer while a 35\textendash 285-m-thick interfacial layer above showed signs of vigorous mixing, overturns up to 30 m thick, and extensive zones of gradient Richardson numbers below 1/4. Turbulent overturning scales, or Thorpe scales, are extracted from regular CTD profiles and equated to Ozmidov scales. On this basis, interfacial mixing is quantified in terms of estimated turbulent dissipation rates, vertical turbulent salt flux, and interfacial stress. Even though these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, they demonstrate the intensity of mixing during strong winter outflow in terms of eddy diffusivities K␳ on the order of 10Ϫ2 m2 sϪ1. The large K␳ occur in strong stratification such that vertical turbulent salt fluxes are also large. Along the NC, relative maxima of K␳ correspond to maxima in the bulk Froude number. Direct short-term measurements of the Reynolds stress just above the seafloor at two locations, one in the NC and one in the SC, allow comparisons of the bottom stress ␶b with the interfacial turbulent stress ␶i. The ratio ␶i/␶b shows large scatter in a small sample, with maximum values on the order of 1.

  abstract = {It is shown theoretically and observed experimentally that spontaneous motions are set up in a stably stratified diffusive fluid in a container whose side-walls are not vertical. The fluid streams up or down the inclined walls in a kind of boundary layer whose Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the Prandtl number. Distributions of velocity and density are found, together with the mass transport in the layer. The same phenomenon results in convective transport along narrow fissures inclined to the vertical that can greatly exceed the diffusive transport associated with the overall gradient. This is particularly so when the fissure is almost horizontal; the convective mass transport is found to be proportional to the cube of the average density gradient along the fissure and to the ninth power of the fissure width.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this work a profiling CTD, operated from the research platform FLIP, is used to monitor the fine-scale density field as a function of both depth and time. A sequence of 10 000 CTD profiles from the surface to 560 m is examined. The data were obtained off the Southern California coast in the 1986 PATCHEX experiment. The vertical separation between successive isopycynal surfaces is tracked. The separation is related to the vertical derivative of vertical displacement, and is here referred to as the strain. The purpose of this work is to present a simple picture of the fine scale strain field as it evolves in time as well as depth. When viewed in isopycnal following coordinates, the qualitative nature of the strain field depends on the characteristic vertical scale over which it is estimated. The ``20 m strain'' field has a wavelike character, dominated by inertial and semidiurnal tidal motion. Wavelike fluctuations are seen in the 20 m strain field even at subinertial frequencies. This suggests that nonlinear processes are significant even at these relatively large vertical scales. The ``2 m strain'' more closely resembles the classic picture of fine structure. Lenses of low density gradient fluid are separated by sheets of higher gradient water. The lenses are seen to persist up to eight hours. They can propagate with respect to the density field over tens of meters. The low gradient regions evolve into regions of high gradient and visa versa. The probability density function (PDF) of isopycnal separation is Gaussian for isopycnal pairs of large ({$\sim$}20 m) mean separation. As mean separation distance is decreased, the skewness of the distribution increases. Since all scalar fields in the sea are strained by the same velocity field, fluctuations in the fine-scale vertical gradients of a variety of quantities are correlated. Averages of the products of fine scale gradients can differ significantly from products of the averages.},

  abstract = {The oceanic internal wave spectrum has long been interpreted as being shaped by nonlinear processes. The empirical Garrett and Munk synthesis of oceanic observations is E (m, ␻) {$\varkappa$} NmϪ2␻Ϫ2 at high wavenumber and frequency. Results of both approximate analytic and numerical estimates of weak nonlinear interactions under the resonant interaction approximation have previously been interpreted as implying the dominance of scaleseparated interactions and that the Garrett and Munk spectrum is stationary with respect to the nonlinear interactions. However, dimensional analysis cobbled together with several basic observational constraints requires a stationary spectrum of E (m, ␻) {$\varkappa$} NmϪ2␻Ϫ3/2 at high vertical wavenumber and frequency. Given this stationary spectrum, dimensional analysis and extant data are used to infer a flux representation for the spectral transports. The resulting semiempirical flux laws can be described as a relaxation to the stationary power laws. The stationary spectrum is consistent with energy sources at low frequencies and dissipation at higher frequencies and vertical wavenumber. The analysis is then extended to include vertically asymmetric wave fields. Vertical wavenumber spectra of horizontal velocity that exhibit a difference between rotary (clockwise and counterclockwise phase rotation of the velocity vector with depth) spectra at large wavelengths tend to be symmetric at smaller scales. This pattern is hypothesized to be a result of nonlinearity within the wave field. In particular, vertical symmetry is linked here to the issue of momentum conservation. A backscattering process is invoked to achieve momentum conservation. This representation of nonlinearity is used in a numerical scheme to assess the spatial evolution of a bottom-generated wave field. The predicted patterns of relaxation and vertical symmetry are in reasonable agreement with finescale observations above rough bathymetry in the Brazil Basin.},

Such observations implicate the bottom boundary as an energy source for the finescale internal wave field. Simple analytical and numerical solutions to an equation governing the spatial and temporal evolution of the finescale wave field are described here. The governing equation implicitly treats the effects of wave breaking on the vertical propagation of internal waves through a flux representation of nonlinear transports associated with internal wave\textendash wave interactions. These solutions identify the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy with downscale energy transports at high vertical wavenumber, resulting in an estimate of dissipation versus depth. The sensitivity of the turbulent dissipation depth profile to various environmental parameters is examined. Observed dissipation profiles and shear spectra are compared with these solutions, and an effort is made to relate the solutions and observations to extant models of internal wave generation and scattering.},

  abstract = {Finescale vertical wavenumber strain spectra (strain: normalized buoyancy frequency variability or vertical derivative of isopycnal displacement) are consistently less steep than shear spectra (shear: vertical derivative of horizontal velocity) for vertical wavelengths smaller than several tens of meters. Interpreting the diminished ratio of shear to strain (shear/strain {$\epsilon$} horizontal kinetic/available potential energy) at higher vertical wavenumber as due to a greater contribution from high-frequency internal waves is not consistent with extant internal wave\textendash wave interaction theories. A contribution from low-aspect-ratio subinertial density fine structure (flattened structures referred to herein as vortical modes) is therefore hypothesized. Vertical wavenumber spectra for vortical mode shear and strain are inferred from the observed spectra. Observed correlations between shear squared and buoyancy frequency squared exist that cannot be explained by either linear internal waves or geostrophic vortical modes. A model of internal wave\textendash vortical mode interactions is used to interpret the observed correlations and partition the finescale spectra into internal wave and vortical mode components. A simple Doppler shift model is used with current meter data to refine the partitioning. The inferred vortical modes have an aspect ratio of approximately f /N ( f : Coriolis frequency, N: buoyancy frequency), an rms velocity of 0.7 cm sϪ1, and bandwidthlimited gradient spectra. At vertical wavelengths larger than 30 m the vortical modes are inferred to be quasigeostrophic and in thermal wind balance. The data are interpreted as exhibiting an approximate equipartition between waves and vortical modes at vertical wavelengths smaller than 10 m.},

  abstract = {Abstract The hydraulics of flow contained in a channel and having nonuniform potential vorticity is considered from a general standpoint. The channel cross section is rectangular and the potential vorticity is assumed to be prescribed in terms of the streamfunction. We show that the general computational problem can be expressed in two traditional forms, the first of which consists of an algebraic relation between the channel geometry and a single dependent flow variable and the second of which consists of a pair of quasi-linear differential equations relating the geometry to two dependent flow variables. From these forms we derive a general ``branch condition'' indicating a merger of different solutions having the same flow rate and energy and show that this condition implies that the flow is critical with respect to a certain long wave. It is shown that critical flow can occur only at the sill in a channel of constant width (with one exception) at a point of width extremum in a flat bottom channel. We also discuss the situation in which the fluid becomes detached from one of sidewalls. An example is given in which the potential vorticity is a linear function of the streamfunction and the rotation rate is zero, a case which can be solved analytically. When the potential vorticity gradient points downstream, allowing propagation of potential vorticity waves against the flow, multiple pairs of steady states are possible, each having a unique modal structure. Critical control of the higher-mode solutions is primarily over vorticity, rather than depth. Flow reversals arise in some situations, possible invalidating the prescription of potential vorticity.},

  abstract = {The continuous dynamical modes of the exchange flow in the Bab al Mandab are computed in an attempt to assess the hydraulic character of the flow at the sill. First, an extended version of the Taylor\textendash Goldstein equation for long waves that accounts for cross-channel topographic variations, is developed. A series of calculations using idealized background velocity U(z) and buoyancy frequency N(z) are presented to illustrate the effects of simple topographic cross sections on the internal modes and their speeds. Next, hydrographic and direct velocity measurements from April to November 1996 using moored CTDs and a bottom-mounted ADCP are utilized to construct monthly mean vertical profiles of N2(z) and at the U(z) sill. An analytical approximation of the true topography across the strait is also constructed. The observed monthly mean profiles are then used to solve for the phase speeds of the first and second internal modes. Additional calculations are carried out using a selection of ``instantaneous'' (2-h average) profiles measured during extremes of the semidiurnal tide. The results are compared with a three-layer analysis of data from the previous year.},

The strait is 150 km long and contains two distinct geometrical choke points: the Hanish sill and Perim narrows. The authors use a three-layer approximation of the monthly mean velocity and density structure at the sill and narrows to calculate the phase speeds of the first and second internal, long gravity waves. The first (second) mode is generally characterized by in-phase (out-of-phase) motions of the two interfaces. The calculations take cross-strait topographic variations into consideration by using a piecewise linear representation of the actual bottom. The resulting phase speeds are used to determine whether the flow is subcritical, supercritical, or critical with respect to the first and second modes. Subcritical (supercritical) means that the two wave pairs corresponding to a given mode propagate in opposite (the same) directions, whereas ``critical'' means that one or both members of a pair has zero phase speed. Critical or supercritical conditions are indications of hydraulic control and imply that signal propagation through the strait associated with a particular mode can occur in only one direction, or perhaps not at all.},

We attempt to trace these waters from their sources to the abyssal Pacific and Indian oceans by examining distributions of temperature and salinity along a stratum defined by density parameters. We assume that the major flow and mixing will take place along such surfaces, though the results make plain that vertical mixing is also important. The density stratum we have chosen to examine extends from the sea surface in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and from near the surface in the Weddell Sea to depths of about 3500 m in the central oceans and below 4000 m in the North Pacific. The cold and saline water of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea is traced along the density stratum through the Denmark Strait, where vertical mixing raises both temperature and salinity to their maximum values in the central North Atlantic. From there the temperature and salinity decrease monotonically southward toward the Weddell Sea, partly by lateral mixing with the cold, low-salinity waters on this stratum where it lies near the sea surface in the Weddell Sea, and partly by vertical mixing with the underlying Antarctic Bottom Water. From the southern South Atlantic the high values of temperature and salinity (the stratum now lies close to the vertical maximum in salinity) extend eastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the Indian and Pacific oceans, with monotonically decreasing temperature and salinity as further vertical mixing erodes the maximum in salinity, until the salinity maximum is found at the bottom in the North Pacific Ocean.},

Discrete analytic mountain-wave solutions are presented for the classical problem of cross-mountain flow in an atmosphere with constant wind speed and stability. Time-dependent linear numerical solutions are also obtained for more realistic atmospheric structures. On one hand, using second-order-accurate finite differences on an Arakawa C grid to model nonhydrostatic flow over what might be supposed to be an adequately resolved 8Dx-wide mountain can lead to an overamplification of the standing mountain wave by 30\%\textendash 40\%. On the other hand, the same finitedifference scheme underestimates the wave amplitude in hydrostatic flow over an 8Dx-wide mountain. Increasing the accuracy of the advection scheme to the fourth order significantly reduces the numerical errors associated with both the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic discrete solutions. The Coupled Ocean\textendash Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) model is used to generate two 70-member ensemble simulations of a mountain-wave event during the Terrain-Induced Rotor Experiment. It is shown that switching from second-order advection to fourth-order advection leads to as much as a 20 m s21 decrease in vertical velocity on the lee side of the Sierra Nevada, and that the weaker fourth-order solutions are more consistent with observations.},

  abstract = {It is found that in a rotating stratified fluid bounded by a single rigid wall, edge waves may occur at all frequencies less than or equal to N sin a (a is the angle of the wall from the horizontal and N the Brunt-Vaisala frequency). These decay exponentially away from the boundary, in a distance of O(S) wavelengths, for {$\alpha$} = O(1), or O(S -1) wavelengths, for {$\alpha$}S {$\leq$} O(1), where S is the ratio of N to the Coriolis parameter f, taken for illustration to be large. The phase and energy both move with a component to the left, facing shallow water. The waves could, for example, appear as an internal tide at the continental rise or as baroclinic meandering of currents over a slope. The low-frequency limit, {$\alpha$}S {$\ll$} 1, is studied in detail. To allow for large scales of motion other rigid boundaries and variations in f are included. The edge (actually ``bottom") waves then merge with topographic-planetary waves as the wavelengths increase; the familiar depth-independent mode is found to be possible in the sea for wavelengths exceeding about 450 km. The \ss -effect introduces modes complementary to that trapped at the bottom, which instead are isolated from it.},

However, it is only in the past 50 years that the key role of the tides in driving ocean mixing has been recognised. Here we review progress made in the identi cation and parameterisation of the pathways of tidal energy, from generation to dissipation and mixing, in a range of ocean environments. The review highlights the key role of tidal dissipation in driving heat, freshwater and biogeochemical uxes across a range of scales and environments, highlighting the need for representation of the small-scale mixing processes supported by the tide in both regional and global ocean and climate models. We also consider the variation in tidal dissipation through different stages of the Earth's geological history and its impact on the evolution of the Earth\textendash Moon system. We further present a number of examples of past climate states to demonstrate that present tides and tidal dissipation rates are a poor proxy for past and future levels of tidally driven oceanic mixing.},

A detailed description of the conservation laws of this vertical-plane-wave model illuminates the mechanism of stimulated generation associated with vertical vorticity and lateral strain. There are two sources of wave potential energy, and corresponding sinks of balanced kinetic energy: the refractive convergence of wave action density into anti-cyclones (and divergence from cyclones); and the enhancement of wave-field gradients by geostrophic straining. We quantify these energy transfers and describe the phenomenology of stimulated generation using numerical solutions of an initially uniform inertial oscillation interacting with mature freely evolving two-dimensional turbulence. In all solutions, stimulated generation co-exists with a transfer of balanced kinetic energy to large scales via vortex merging. Also, geostrophic straining accounts for most of the generation of wave potential energy, representing a sink of 10~\%\textendash 20~\% of the initial balanced kinetic energy. However, refraction is fundamental because it creates the initial eddy-scale lateral gradients in the near-inertial field that are then enhanced by advection. In these quasi-inviscid solutions, wave dispersion is the only mechanism that upsets stimulated generation: with a barotropic balanced flow, lateral straining enhances the wave group velocity, so that waves accelerate and rapidly escape from straining regions. This wave escape prevents wave energy from cascading to dissipative scales.},

  abstract = {To close the abyssal overturning circulation, dense bottom water has to become lighter by mixing with lighter water above. This diapycnal mixing is strongly enhanced over rough topography in abyssal mixing layers, which span the bottom few hundred meters of the water column. In particular, mixing rates are enhanced over mid-ocean ridge systems, which extend for thousands of kilometers in the global ocean and are thought to be key contributors to the required abyssal water mass transformation. To examine how stratification and thus diabatic transformation is maintained in such abyssal mixing layers, this study explores the circulation driven by bottom-intensified mixing over mid-ocean ridge flanks and within ridge-flank canyons. Idealized numerical experiments show that stratification over the ridge flanks is maintained by submesoscale baroclinic eddies and that stratification within ridge-flank canyons is maintained by mixing-driven mean flows. These restratification processes affect how strong a diabatic buoyancy flux into the abyss can be maintained, and they are essential for maintaining the dipole in water mass transformation that has emerged as the hallmark of a diabatic circulation driven by bottom-intensified mixing.},

Standard model simulations are generally only a few hundred years long. However, modeling the long-term equilibration in response to radiative forcing perturbation is important for understanding many climate phenomena, such as the evolution of ocean circulation, time- and temperature-dependent feedbacks, and the differentiation of forced signal and internal variability. The aim of LongRunMIP is to facilitate research into these questions by serving as an archive for simulations that capture as much of this equilibration as possible. The only requirement to participate in LongRunMIP is to contribute a simulation with elevated, constant CO               2               forcing that lasts at least 1,000 years. LongRunMIP is an MIP of opportunity in that the simulations were mostly performed prior to the conception of the archive without an agreed-upon set of experiments. For most models, the archive contains a preindustrial control simulation and simulations with an idealized (typically abrupt) CO               2               forcing. We collect 2D surface and top-of-atmosphere fields and 3D ocean temperature and salinity fields. Here, we document the collection of simulations and discuss initial results, including the evolution of surface and deep ocean temperature and cloud radiative effects. As of October 2019, the collection includes 50 simulations of 15 models by 10 modeling centers. The data of LongRunMIP are publicly available. We encourage submissions of more simulations in the future.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that ocean western boundaries are the primary regions of eddy energy dissipation. Globally, the eddy energy sinks have been estimated to integrate to about 0.2 TW. This is a sizable fraction of the tidal energy dissipation in the deep oceanic interior, estimated at about 1.0 TW and contributing to diapycnal mixing. The authors conduct sensitivity experiments with an ocean general circulation model assuming that the eddy energy is scattered into high-wavenumber vertical modes, resulting in energy dissipation and locally enhanced diapycnal mixing. When only the tidal energy dissipation maintains diapycnal mixing, the overturning circulation, and stratification in the deep ocean are too weak. With the addition of the eddy dissipation, the deep-ocean thermal structure becomes closer to that observed and the overturning circulation and stratification in the abyss become stronger. Furthermore, the mixing associated with the eddy dissipation can, on its own, drive a relatively strong overturning. The stratification and overturning in the deep ocean are sensitive to the vertical structure of diapycnal mixing. When most of this energy dissipates within 300 m above the bottom, the abyssal overturning and stratification are too weak. Allowing for the dissipation to penetrate higher in the water column, such as suggested by recent observations, results in stronger stratification and meridional circulation. Zonal circulation is also affected. In particular, the Drake Passage transport becomes closer to its observational estimates with the increase in the vertical scale for turbulence above topography. Consistent with some theoretical models, the Drake Passage transport increases with the increase in the mean upper-ocean diffusivity.},

  abstract = {The strong influence of enhanced diapycnal mixing over rough topography on bottom-water circulation is illustrated using results from two global ocean model experiments. In the first, diapycnal diffusivity is set to the observed background level of 10Ϫ5 m2 sϪ1 in regions not subject to shear instability, convection, or surface-driven mixing. In the second experiment, mixing is enhanced above rough bottom topography to represent the dissipation of internal tides. Three important results are obtained. First, without the enhanced mixing in the abyssal ocean, the deep North Pacific Ocean becomes essentially a stagnant basin, with little bottom-water circulation and very weak deep stratification. Allowing for the enhanced diapycnal mixing above rough bottom topography leads to increased bottom-water circulation and deep stratification and a potential vorticity distribution in the North Pacific that is much more realistic. Second, the enhanced diapycnal mixing above rough topography results in a significant intensification and deepening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as well as in stronger bottom-water formation around Antarctica. Last, our experiments suggest that dissipation of internal tides and the associated enhanced diapycnal mixing in the abyssal ocean play no part in the circulation of deep water forming in the North Atlantic Ocean and in the associated transport of heat in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The diapycnal diffusivity of mass supported by turbulent events in the ocean interior plays a fundamental role in controlling the global overturning circulation. The conventional representation of this diffusivity, due to Osborn (1980), assumes a constant mixing efficiency. We replace this methodology by a generalized-Osborn formula which involves a mixing efficiency that varies nonmonotonically with at least two nondimensional variables. Using these two variables, we propose dynamic parameterizations for mixing efficiency and turbulent Prandtl number (the latter quantifies the ratio of momentum to mass diapycnal diffusivities) based on the first synthesis of an extensive direct numerical simulation of inhomogeneously stratified shear-induced turbulence. Data from Argo floats are employed to demonstrate the extent of the spatial and statistical variability to be expected in both the diapycnal diffusivities of mass and momentum. We therefore suggest that previous estimates of these important characteristics of the global ocean require reconsideration.},

We document the spatial distribution of long-term large-scale trends in temperature, salinity, and core depth over the Antarctic continental shelf and slope. Warming at the seabed in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas is linked to increased heat content and to a shoaling of the mid-depth temperature maximum over the continental slope, allowing warmer, saltier water greater access to the shelf in recent years. Regions of ASBW warming are those exhibiting increased ice shelf melt.},

  abstract = {Abstract The large-scale consequences of diapycnal mixing location are explored using an idealized three-dimensional model of buoyancy-forced flow in a single hemisphere. Diapycnal mixing is most effective in supporting a strong meridional overturning circulation (MOC) if mixing occurs in regions of strong stratification, that is, in the low-latitude thermocline where diffusion causes strong vertical buoyancy fluxes. Where stratification is weak, such as at high latitudes, diapycnal mixing plays little role in determining MOC strength, consistent with weak diffusive buoyancy fluxes at these latitudes. Boundary mixing is more efficient than interior mixing at driving the MOC; with interior mixing the planetary vorticity constraint inhibits the communication of interior water mass properties and the eastern boundary. Mixing below the thermocline affects the abyssal stratification and upwelling profile but does not contribute significantly to the meridional flow through the thermocline or the ocean's meridional heat transport. The abyssal heat budget is dominated by the downward mass transport of buoyant water versus the spread of denser water tied to the properties of deep convection, with mixing of minor importance. These results are in contrast to the widespread expectation that the observed enhanced abyssal mixing can maintain the MOC; rather, they suggest that enhanced boundary mixing in the thermocline needs to be identified in observations.},

  abstract = {Measurements of turbulence dissipation, current, and stratification in an energetic, sloping tidal channel, the Penghu Channel (PHC), in the Taiwan Strait were conducted to investigate temporal variations of turbulence properties in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) under different stratified conditions. It was found that the PHC exhibits a unique feature of semidiurnal cycle of turbulence in the BBL due to the fact that current speeds during the flood are much higher than those during the ebb. Turbulent mixing in the BBL, produced mainly by the tidal current shear, has high values of dissipation (similar to 10(-5) W Kg(-1)) and eddy diffusivity and extends upward to approximately 40 m above the bottom during the flood. During the flood upslope flow, significant temperature drop and destratification of the near-bottom layer occur due to turbulence mixing associated with the shear instabilities, confirmed by the gradient Richardson number less than the critical value of 1/4. By contrast, stratification produced during the ebb is discernible only in the upper part of the BBL above the mixed layer. The stratification is weak (strong) during enhanced (suppressed) turbulence. The observed dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is proportional to the cubic power of current speed, suggesting that the observed turbulence is generated via the boundary layer shear instability.},

This is partly due to inadequate long records of seasonal reforecasts that make skill estimates of irregular ENSO events quite challenging. Here, we investigate ENSO predictability and the dependency of prediction skill on the ENSO cycle using 110 years of 24-month-long 10-member ensemble reforecasts from ECMWF's coupled model (SEAS5-20C) initialized on 1 November and 1 May during 1901\textendash 2010. Results show that Ni\~no-3.4 SST can be skillfully predicted up to {$\sim$}18 lead months when initialized on 1 November, but skill drops at {$\sim$}12 lead months for May starts that encounter the boreal spring predictability barrier in year 2. The skill beyond the first year is highly conditioned to the phase of ENSO: Forecasts initialized at peak El Ni\~no are more skillful in year 2 than those initialized at peak La Ni\~na, with the transition to La Ni\~na being more predictable than to El Ni\~no. This asymmetry is related to the subsurface initial conditions in the western equatorial Pacific: peak El Ni\~no states evolving into La Ni\~na are associated with strong upper-ocean heat discharge of the western Pacific, the memory of which stays beyond 1 year. In contrast, the western Pacific recharged state associated with La Ni\~na is usually weaker and shorter-lived, being a weaker preconditioner for subsequent El Ni\~no, the year after. High prediction skill of ENSO events beyond 1 year provides motivation for extending the lead time of operational seasonal forecasts up to 2 years.},

Their most general formulation follows from the Hamiltonian structure of geophysical fluid dynamics. For large-scale atmospheric dynamics, the Eliassen\textendash Palm wave activity is a well-known example and is central to theoretical analysis. On the mesoscale, while such conservation laws have been worked out in two dimensions, their application to a horizontally homogeneous background flow in three dimensions fails because of a degeneracy created by the absence of a background potential vorticity gradient. Earlier three-dimensional results based on linear WKB theory considered only Doppler-shifted gravity waves, not waves in a stratified shear flow. Consideration of a background flow depending only on altitude is motivated by the parameterization of subgrid-scales in climate models where there is an imposed separation of horizontal length and time scales, but vertical coupling within each column. Here we show how this degeneracy can be overcome and wave-activity conservation laws derived for three-dimensional disturbances to a horizontally homogeneous background flow. Explicit expressions for pseudoenergy and pseudomomentum in the anelastic and Boussinesq models are derived, and it is shown how the previously derived relations for the two-dimensional problem can be treated as a limiting case of the three-dimensional problem. The results also generalize earlier three-dimensional results in that there is no slowly varying WKB-type requirement on the background flow, and the results are extendable to finite amplitude.

  abstract = {Abstract Lateral stirring is a basic oceanographic phenomenon affecting the distribution of physical, chemical, and biological fields. Eddy stirring at scales on the order of 100 km (the mesoscale) is fairly well understood and explicitly represented in modern eddy-resolving numerical models of global ocean circulation. The same cannot be said for smaller-scale stirring processes. Here, the authors describe a major oceanographic field experiment aimed at observing and understanding the processes responsible for stirring at scales of 0.1\textendash 10 km. Stirring processes of varying intensity were studied in the Sargasso Sea eddy field approximately 250 km southeast of Cape Hatteras. Lateral variability of water-mass properties, the distribution of microscale turbulence, and the evolution of several patches of inert dye were studied with an array of shipboard, autonomous, and airborne instruments. Observations were made at two sites, characterized by weak and moderate background mesoscale straining, to contrast different regimes of lateral stirring. Analyses to date suggest that, in both cases, the lateral dispersion of natural and deliberately released tracers was O(1) m2 s\textendash 1 as found elsewhere, which is faster than might be expected from traditional shear dispersion by persistent mesoscale flow and linear internal waves. These findings point to the possible importance of kilometer-scale stirring by submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal-wave processes or the need to modify the traditional shear-dispersion paradigm to include higher-order effects. A unique aspect of the Scalable Lateral Mixing and Coherent Turbulence (LatMix) field experiment is the combination of direct measurements of dye dispersion with the concurrent multiscale hydrographic and turbulence observations, enabling evaluation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed dispersion at a new level.},

  abstract = {Abstract Measurements of vertical shear and strain were acquired from the research platform FLIP during the PATCHEX experiment in October, 1986 (34\textdegree N, 127\textdegree W). Vertical sheer was shear from two separate Doppler sonar systems. A long-range sonar, with independent estimates every 18 m, sampled from 150\textendash 1200 m in depth. A short-range sonar measured fine-scale shear over 150\textendash 180 m depth, with 1.5 m vertical resolution. Vertical strain, {$\partial\eta$}/{$\partial$}z, was estimated from two repeatedly profiling CTDs. These sampled to 560 m once every three minutes. The time variation of the strain field is monitored in both Eulerian (fixed-depth) and semi-Lagrangian (isopycnal-following) reference frames, from 150\textendash 406 m depth. Eulerian vertical wavenumber-frequency (m, {$\omega$}) spectra of vertical shear and strain exhibit a frequency dependency which is a strong function of wavenumber ({$\omega-$}2\textendash{$\omega$}0 for m = 0.01\textendash 0.3 cpm). In contrast the semi-Lagrangian strain spectrum is more nearly separable in frequency and wavenumber, in closer agreement with the Garrett\textendash Munk (GM) internal wave spectral model. When a simulated GM shear field is vertically advected by a GM isopycnal displacement field, the resultant Eulerian vertical wavenumber\textendash frequency spectrum exhibits the same qualitative, nonseparable, form as the PATCHEX shear spectrum: The dominant near-inertial waves are Doppler-shifted across all frequency bands, resulting in a ``while'' frequency spectrum at high wavenumbers. Measured ratios of Eulerian shear/strain variance support this interpretation. Higher shear-low strain variances (characteristic of near-inertial waves) are seen at high wavenumber, high encounter frequencies. The conclusion is that internal wave vertical self-advection strongly alters the observed frequency at high vertical wavenumbers in an Eulerian reference frame.},

An analysis of time-varying dynamical modes is performed. The results for barotropic modes confirm the global surface tide model results of Schwiderski (1980) for this region. The barotropic modes dominate in the deep basins, but increased baroclinic contributions are usually found over rough topography. At three locations near the continental slope in the southern Canary Basin the baroclinic modes dominate the barotropic mode. Results from an array of three moorings at the northern part of the Cape Verde Rise show an inverse behavior of barotropic and baroclinic energies, such that the baroclinic energy is steadily enhanced while the barotropic energy is reduced towards the continental margin. The increase in baroclinic energy is consistent with a generation of internal tides close to the shelf by surface tidal forcing over topography. Further evidence for this process is provided by the 2-week periodicity of the first-order baroclinic mode at the slope, corresponding to the spring-neap cycle of the barotropic tide.},

  abstract = {Abstract Motivated by observations of enhanced near-inertial currents at the island chain of Palau, the modification of wind-generated near-inertial oscillations (NIOs) by the presence of an island is examined using the analytic solutions of Longuet-Higgins and a linear, inviscid, 1.5-layer reduced-gravity model. The analytic solution for oscillations at the inertial frequency f provides insights into flow adjustment near the island but excludes wave dynamics. To account for wave motion, the numerical model initially is forced by a large-scale wind field rotating at f, where the forcing is increased then decreased to zero. Numerical simulations are carried out over a range of island radii and the ocean response detailed. Near the island, wind energy in the frequency band near f can excite subinertial island-trapped waves and superinertial Poincar\'e waves. In the small-island limit, both the Poincar\'e waves and the island-trapped waves are very near f, and their sum resembles the Longuet-Higgins analytic solution but with increased amplitude near the island. The flow field can be viewed as primarily a far-field NIO locally deflected by the island plus an island-trapped contribution, leading to enhanced near-inertial currents near the island, on the scale of the island radius. As the island size is increased, the island-trapped wave frequency deviates further from f and its amplitude depends strongly on the frequency bandwidth and wavenumber structure of the wind forcing. In the large-island limit, the island-trapped wave resembles a Kelvin wave, and the sum of incident and reflected Poincar\'e waves suppresses the near-inertial current amplitude near the island. Significance Statement Strong, impulsive winds over the ocean excite currents that rotate in the opposite direction to Earth's rotation. This work examines how these wind-generated currents, known as near-inertial oscillations (NIOs), are modified by the presence of an island. Around small islands, the primary response is locally enhanced near-inertial currents. Alternatively, around large islands, near-inertial currents are weaker. Understanding how these currents behave should provide insight into the physical processes that drive current variability near islands and spur local mixing.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy input as fresh water exerts a stratifying influence in estuaries and adjacent coastal waters. Predicting the development and breakdown of such stratification is an inherently more difficult problem than that involved in the analogous case of stratification induced by surface heating because the buoyancy input originates at the lateral boundaries. In the approach adopted here, we have adapted the energy considerations used in the surface heating problem to describe the competition between the stabilizing effect of fresh water and the vertical mixing brought about by tidal and wind stirring. Freshwater input induces horizontal gradients which drive the estuarine circulation in which lighter fluid at the surface is moved seaward over heavier fluid moving landward below. This contribution to stratification is expected to vary in time as the level of turbulence varies over the tidal cycle. The density gradient also interacts directly with the vertical shear in the tidal current to induce a periodic input to stratification which is positive on the ebb phase of the tide. Comparison of this input with the available stirring energy leads to a simple criterion for the existence of strain-induced stratification. Observations in a region of Liverpool Bay satisfying this criterion confirm the occurrence of a strong semidiurnal variation in stratification with complete vertical mixing apparent around high water except at neap tides when more permanent stratification may develop. A simulation of the monthly cycle based on a model including straining, stirring, and the estuarine circulation is in qualitative agreement with the main features of the observations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent observations and numerical experiments indicate that during severe downslope windstorms, a large region of slow turbulent air develops in the middle and upper troposphere while strong winds plunge underneath. A mathematical model of this severe wind state is developed using Long's equation. This theory predicts the altitude of the turbulent air, the strength of the winds, and the mountain drag. In the presence of a wind reversal, the theory indicates which wind reversal altitudes will lead to windstorm conditions.},

  abstract = {The influence of freshwater and heat flux changes on Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) properties are investigated within a realistic bathymetry coupled ocean-ice sector model of the Atlantic Ocean. The model simulations are conducted at eddy-permitting resolution where dense shelf water production dominates over open ocean convection in forming AABW. Freshwater and heat flux perturbations are applied independently and have contradictory surface responses, with increased upper-ocean temperature and reduced ice formation under heating and the opposite under increased freshwater fluxes. AABW transport into the abyssal ocean reduces under both flux changes, with the reduction in transport being proportional to the net buoyancy flux anomaly south of 60 degrees S.Through inclusion of shelf-sourced AABW, a process absent from most current generation climate models, cooling and freshening of dense source water is facilitated via reduced on-shelf/off-shelf exchange flow. Such cooling is propagated to the abyssal ocean, while compensating warming in the deep ocean under heating introduces a decadal-scale variability of the abyssal water masses. This study emphasizes the fundamental role buoyancy plays in controlling AABW, as well as the importance of the inclusion of shelf-sourced AABW within climate models in order to attain the complete spectrum of possible climate change responses.},

  abstract = {Water-mass transformation by turbulent mixing is a key part of the deep-ocean overturning, as it drives the upwelling of dense waters formed at high latitudes. Here, we quantify this transformation and its underpinning processes in a small Southern Ocean basin: the Orkney Deep. Observations reveal a focusing of the transport in density space as a deep western boundary current (DWBC) flows through the region, associated with lightening and densification of the current's denser and lighter layers, respectively. These transformations are driven by vigorous turbulent mixing. Comparing this transformation with measurements of the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation indicates that, within the DWBC, turbulence operates with a high mixing efficiency, characterized by a dissipation ratio of 0.6 to 1 that exceeds the common value of 0.2. This result is corroborated by estimates of the dissipation ratio from microstructure observations. The causes of the transformation are unraveled through a decomposition into contributions dependent on the gradients in density space of the: dianeutral mixing rate, isoneutral area, and stratification. The transformation is found to be primarily driven by strong turbulence acting on an abrupt transition from the weakly stratified bottom boundary layer to well-stratified off-boundary waters. The reduced boundary layer stratification is generated by a downslope Ekman flow associated with the DWBC's flow along sloping topography, and is further regulated by submesoscale instabilities acting to restratify near-boundary waters. Our results provide observational evidence endorsing the importance of near-boundary mixing processes to deep-ocean overturning, and highlight the role of DWBCs as hot spots of dianeutral upwelling.},

  abstract = {Evidence is presented for the transfer of energy from low-frequency inertial\textendash diurnal internal waves to highfrequency waves in the band between 6 cpd and the buoyancy frequency. This transfer links the most energetic waves in the spectrum, those receiving energy directly from the winds, barotropic tides, and parametric subharmonic instability, with those most directly involved in the breaking process. Transfer estimates are based on month-long records of ocean velocity and temperature obtained continuously over 80\textendash 800 m from the research platform (R/P) Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP) in the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME) Nearfield (2002) and Farfield (2001) experiments, in Hawaiian waters. Triple correlations between low-frequency vertical shears and high-frequency Reynolds stresses, huiw\guilsinglright Ui/\guilsinglright zi, are used to estimate energy transfers. These are supported by bispectral analysis, which show significant energy transfers to pairs of waves with nearly identical frequency. Wavenumber bispectra indicate that the vertical scales of the high-frequency waves are unequal, with one wave of comparable scale to that of the low-frequency parent and the other of much longer scale. The scales of the high-frequency waves contrast with the classical pictures of induced diffusion and elastic scattering interactions and violates the scale-separation assumption of eikonal models of interaction. The possibility that the observed waves are Doppler shifted from intrinsic frequencies near f or N is explored. Peak transfer rates in the Nearfield, an energetic tidal conversion site, are on the order of 2 3 1027 W kg21 and are of similar magnitude to estimates of turbulent dissipation that were made near the ridge during HOME. Transfer rates in the Farfield are found to be about half the Nearfield values.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the available potential energy (               APE               ) framework of Winters               et al               . (               J. Fluid Mech.               , vol. 289, 1995, p. 115) is extended to the fully compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations, with the aims of clarifying (i) the nature of the energy conversions taking place in turbulent thermally stratified fluids; and (ii) the role of surface buoyancy fluxes in the Munk \& Wunsch (               Deep-Sea Res.               , vol. 45, 1998, p. 1977) constraint on the mechanical energy sources of stirring required to maintain diapycnal mixing in the oceans. The new framework reveals that the observed turbulent rate of increase in the background gravitational potential energy                                GPE                 r                              , commonly thought to occur at the expense of the diffusively dissipated               APE               , actually occurs at the expense of internal energy, as in the laminar case. The               APE               dissipated by molecular diffusion, on the other hand, is found to be converted into internal energy (               IE               ), similar to the viscously dissipated kinetic energy               KE               . Turbulent stirring, therefore, does not introduce a new               APE               /                                GPE                 r                              mechanical-to-mechanical energy conversion, but simply enhances the existing               IE               /                                GPE                 r                              conversion rate, in addition to enhancing the viscous dissipation and the entropy production rates. This, in turn, implies that molecular diffusion contributes to the dissipation of the available mechanical energy               ME               =               APE               +               KE               , along with viscous dissipation. This result has important implications for the interpretation of the concepts of mixing efficiency {$\gamma$}                                mixing                              and flux Richardson number                                R                 f                              , for which new physically based definitions are proposed and contrasted with previous definitions.                                         The new framework allows for a more rigorous and general re-derivation from the first principles of Munk \& Wunsch (1998, hereafter MW98)'s constraint, also valid for a non-Boussinesq ocean:                                                              where               G               (               KE               ) is the work rate done by the mechanical forcing,                                W                 r, forcing                              is the rate of loss of                                GPE                 r                              due to high-latitude cooling and {$\xi$} is a nonlinearity parameter such that {$\xi$} = 1 for a linear equation of state (as considered by MW98), but {$\xi$} {$<$} 1 otherwise. The most important result is that               G               (               APE               ), the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes, must be numerically as large as                                W                 r, forcing                              and, therefore, as important as the mechanical forcing in stirring and driving the oceans. As a consequence, the overall mixing efficiency of the oceans is likely to be larger than the value {$\gamma$}                                mixing                              = 0.2 presently used, thereby possibly eliminating the apparent shortfall in mechanical stirring energy that results from using {$\gamma$}                                mixing                              = 0.2 in the above formula.},

  abstract = {Lorenz's theory of available potential energy (APE) remains the main framework for studying the atmospheric and oceanic energy cycles. Because the APE generation rate is the volume integral of a thermodynamic efficiency times the local diabatic heating/cooling rate, APE theory is often regarded as an extension of the theory of heat engines. Available energetics in classical thermodynamics, however, usually relies on the concept of exergy and is usually measured relative to a reference-state maximizing entropy at constant energy, whereas APE's reference state minimizes potential energy at constant entropy. This review seeks to shed light on the two concepts; it covers local formulations of available energetics, alternative views of the dynamics/thermodynamics coupling, APE theory and the second law of thermodynamics, APE production/dissipation, extensions to binary fluids, mean/eddy decompositions, APE in incompressible fluids, APE and irreversible turbulent mixing, and the role of mechanical forcing on APE production.},

  abstract = {The meridional overturning circulation for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans is computed from absolute geostrophic velocity estimates based on hydrographic data and from climatological Ekman transports. The Atlantic overturn includes the expected North Atlantic Deep Water formation (including Labrador Sea Water and Nordic Sea Overflow Water), with an amplitude of about 18 Sv through most of the Atlantic and an error of the order of 3\textendash 5 Sv (1 Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1). The Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (Antarctic Bottom Water) flows north with about 8 Sv of upwelling and a southward return in the South Atlantic, and 6 Sv extending to and upwelling in the North Atlantic. The northward flow of 8 Sv in the upper layer in the Atlantic (sea surface through the Antarctic Intermediate Water) is transformed to lower density in the Tropics before losing buoyancy in the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current. The Pacific overturning streamfunction includes 10 Sv of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water flowing north into the South Pacific to upwell and return southward as Pacific Deep Water, and a North Pacific Intermediate Water cell of 2 Sv. The northern North Pacific has no active deep water formation at the sea surface, but in this analysis there is downwelling from the Antarctic Intermediate Water into the Pacific Deep Water, with upwelling in the Tropics. For global Southern Hemisphere overturn across 30\cyrchar\CYRNJE S, the overturning is separated into a deep and a shallow overturning cell. In the deep cell, 22\textendash 27 Sv of deep water flows southward and returns northward as bottom water. In the shallow cell, 9 Sv flows southward at low density and returns northward just above the intermediate water density. In all three oceans, the Tropics appear to dominate upwelling across isopycnals, including the migration of the deepest waters upward to the thermocline in the Indian and Pacific. Estimated diffusivities associated with this tropical upwelling are the same order of magnitude in all three oceans.},

However, the exact pathways and role of topography in Southern Ocean upwelling remain largely unknown. Here we show detailed upwelling pathways in three dimensions, using hydrographic observations and particle tracking in high-resolution models. The analysis reveals that the northern-sourced deep waters enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current via southward flow along the boundaries of the three ocean basins, before spiraling southeastward and upward through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Upwelling is greatly enhanced at five major topographic features, associated with vigorous mesoscale eddy activity. Deep water reaches the upper ocean predominantly south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a spatially nonuniform distribution. The timescale for half of the deep water to upwell from 30\textdegree{} S to the mixed layer is \textasciitilde 60\textendash 90 years.},

  abstract = {Upwelling of northern deep waters in the Southern Ocean is fundamentally important for the closure of the global meridional overturning circulation and delivers carbon and nutrient-rich deep waters to the sea surface. We quantify water mass transformation along upwelling pathways originating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific and ending at the surface of the Southern Ocean using Lagrangian trajectories in an eddy-permitting ocean state estimate. Recent related work shows that upwelling in the interior below about 400 m depth is localized at hot spots associated with major topographic features in the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while upwelling through the surface layer is more broadly distributed. In the ocean interior upwelling is largely isopycnal; Atlantic and to a lesser extent Indian Deep Waters cool and freshen while Pacific deep waters are more stable, leading to a homogenization of water mass properties. As upwelling water approaches the mixed layer, there is net strong transformation toward lighter densities due to mixing of freshwater, but there is a divergence in the density distribution as Upper Circumpolar Deep Water tends become lighter and dense Lower Circumpolar Deep Water tends to become denser. The spatial distribution of transformation shows more rapid transformation at eddy hot spots associated with major topography where density gradients are enhanced; however, the majority of cumulative density change along trajectories is achieved by background mixing. We compare the Lagrangian analysis to diagnosed Eulerian water mass transformation to attribute the mechanisms leading to the observed transformation.},

Datasets from two non-overlapping 15-day observation periods are considered. Dispersion curves of three low-order normal modes at frequencies below 110 Hz are extracted from the EGFs with the timewarping technique. The dispersion curves from the first dataset were previously employed to estimate the seabed properties. Here, using this seabed model, we invert the differences between the dispersion curves obtained from the two datasets for the variation of the time-averaged sound speed profile (SSP) in water between the two observation periods. Results of the passive SSP inversion of the second dataset are compared with the ground truth derived from in situ temperature measurements. The effect of temporal variability of the water column during noise-averaging time on EGF retrieval is discussed and quantified. VC 2021 Acoustical Society of America.},

Satellite altimeter data sets,               in situ               observations and global scale ocean model outputs collected over the past one decade reveal significant variability in the balance-to-wave energy ratio in the world's oceans. Notably, wave-dominant regions of the world's oceans are characterized by the internal gravity wave spectrum overtaking the geostrophic balanced flow's spectrum at mesoscales. Inspired by these recent data sets, in this paper we explore turbulent interactions between a broad spectrum of internal gravity waves and the geostrophic balanced flow in different balance-to-wave energy regimes. Our results based on numerical integration of the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations reveal that the balanced flow remains unaffected by waves as long as wave energy is not significantly higher than balanced energy. Even in parameter regimes where wave and balanced energies are comparable, balanced flow undergoes an inverse energy flux with energy accumulating in large domain-scale coherent vortices. In contrast, we find that wave-dominant regimes are composed of two-way wave\textendash balance energy exchanges and a forward flux of geostrophic energy. The geostrophic balanced flow in such regimes is composed of fine-scale structures that get dissipated at small scales and show no sign of coherent vortex formation. Our findings reveal that sufficiently high energy waves can reverse the direction of the geostrophic energy flux \textendash{} from inverse to forward \textendash{} enhancing geostrophic energy dissipation. Given that the balance-to-wave energy ratio is highly variable in the global ocean, the forward flux and associated small-scale dissipation of balanced energy could play an important role in high wave energy regions of the world's oceans. The prominent mechanisms suggested for dissipating balanced energy in the world's oceans require balanced flow to encounter different forms of boundaries. In contrast, the wave-induced dissipation of balanced energy described in this paper is an attractive mechanism that could dissipate balanced energy in the interior parts of the oceans and away from all forms of boundaries.},

The return of the salty RSBW to the AAB is revealed by six Deep Argo floats that have occupied the region from January of 2018 to March of 2020. The floats depict a zonal variation in temperature and salinity in the bottom waters of the AAB, driven by the inflow of RSBW. A simple Optimum Multiparameter Analysis based on potential temperature and salinity gives a sense of scale to the composition of the bottom waters, which are nearly 80\% of the new, salty RSBW in the south-east corner of the basin by 2019 and generally less than 40\% to the west closer to the ALBW outflow region and the abyssal plain.},

Diffusivity values are inferred from density/temperature inversions and internal wave vertical strain. Both methods reveal the same pattern of spatial variability across Drake Passage; diffusivity estimates from inversions exceed those from vertical strain by a factor of 3 over most of Drake Passage. The Polar Front (PF) separates two dynamically different regions. Strong thermohaline intrusions characterize profiles obtained north of the PF. South of the PF, stratification is determined largely by salinity, and temperature is typically unstably stratified between 100- and 600-m depth. In the upper 400 m, turbulent diapycnal diffusivities are O(10Ϫ3 m2 sϪ1) north of the PF but decrease to O(10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1) or smaller south of the PF. Below 400 m diffusivities typically exceed 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1. Diffusivities decay weakly with depth north of the PF, whereas diffusivities increase with depth and peak near the local temperature maximum south of the PF. The meridional pattern in near-surface mixing corresponds to local maxima and minima of both wind stress and wind stress variance. Near-surface diffusivities are also found to be larger during winter months north of the PF. Wind-driven near-inertial waves, strong mesoscale eddy activity, and doublediffusive convection are suggested as possible factors contributing to observed mixing patterns.},

  abstract = {The supply of energy to the internal wave field in the ocean is, in total, sufficient to support the mixing required to maintain the stratification of the ocean, but can the required rates of turbulent dissipation in mid-water be sustained by breaking internal waves? It is assumed that turbulence occurs in regions where the field of motion can be represented by an exact solution of the equations that describe waves propagating through a uniformly stratified fluid and becoming unstable. Two instabilities leading to wave breaking are examined, convective instability and shear-induced Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz instability. Models are constrained by data representative of the mid-water ocean. Calculations of turbulent dissipation are first made on the assumption that all the waves representing local breaking have the same steepness, s, and frequency, {$\sigma$} . For some ranges of s and {$\sigma$} , breaking can support the required transfer of energy to turbulence. For convective instability this proves possible for sufficiently large s, typically exceeding 2.0, over a range of {$\sigma$} , while for shear-induced instability near-inertial waves are required. Relaxation of the constraint that the model waves all have the same s and {$\sigma$} requires new assumptions about the nature and consequences of wave breaking. Examples predict an overall dissipation consistent with the observed rates. Further observations are, however, required to test the validity of the assumptions made in the models and, in particular, to determine the nature and frequency of internal wave breaking in the mid-water ocean.},

Group shape is also generally changed on reflection. Wave breaking can be driven by resonant interactions between the incident and reflecting waves or through convective and Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz instability (CI and KHI) of steepening internal waves. Breaking through resonant interactions can occur only in a boundary layer within which incident and reflected groups co-exist. This imposes conditions that depend on the dimensions of incident groups, which may be severe requiring extremely large aspect ratios and implying that in practice the breaking of internal waves in groups incident on or reflected from a slope through CI and KHI often contributes more than resonant wave\textendash wave interactions to mixing near a sloping boundary. Wave breaking associated with self-induced instability of waves in groups will have a greater and possibly more extensive effect on the boundary layer over a slope when the direction in which groups of waves continue to break is close to the up-slope direction of the boundary in the plane of the waves, the effective slope. This is possible only at the small slope angles which are typical of the oceanic continental slopes. Over these slopes internal wave breaking may contribute significantly to the diapycnal mixing of the deep ocean.},

Internal waves (Section 2) can lead to turbulence by creating regions of unstable density gradients through their mutual interactions, by individually breaking by forming rotors, and by reducing the local Richardson number until Kelvin-Helmholtz instability results. They may be important in radiating energy from turbulent or spreading regions. Critical-layer absorption of internal waves is not found to be a direct cause of turbulence in experiments with 15{$>$} Richardson number {$>$}5, although the modification of the vertical density profile may be significant. Turbulent-laminar interfaces without mean shear (Section 3) and with mean shear (Section 4) are described. The source of turbulence in these experiments is partly external, either generated by an oscillating grid or by a (relatively) moving boundary. The development of turbulence generated entirely within a stratified layer by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, is described in detail in Section 5, and the results are compared with measurements in the ocean and in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs) are commonly used to measure full-depth velocity profiles in the ocean. Because LADCPs are lowered on hydrographic wires, elaborate data processing is required to remove the effects of instrument motion from the velocity measurements and to transform the resulting relative velocity profiles into a nonmoving reference frame. Two fundamentally different methods are used for this purpose: in the velocity inversion method, a set of linear equations is solved to separate the ocean and instrument velocities while simultaneously applying a combination of velocity-referencing constraints from navigational data, shipboard ADCP measurements, and bottom tracking. In the shear method, a gridded profile of velocity shear, which is not affected by instrument motion, is vertically integrated and referenced using a single constraint. The main goals of the present study consist in estimating the accuracy of LADCP-derived velocity profiles and determining which processing method performs better. To this purpose, 21 LADCP profiles collected during four surveys are compared to velocities measured simultaneously by nearby moored instruments at depths between 2000 and 3000 m. The LADCP data were processed with two slightly different publicly available implementations of the velocity inversion method, as well as with an implementation of the shear method that was extended to support multiple simultaneous velocity-referencing constraints. Regardless of the processing method, the overall rms LADCP velocity errors are ,3 cm s21 as long as multiple velocity-referencing constraints are imposed simultaneously. On the other hand, solutions referenced with a single constraint are associated with significantly greater errors. The two primary instrument characteristics that influence data quality are range and sampling rate. Dependence of the LADCP velocity errors on those two parameters was determined by reprocessing range-limited subsets and temporal subsamples of the LADCP data. Results indicate an approximately linear increase of the velocity errors with decreasing sampling rate. The relationship between velocity errors and instrument range is much less linear and characterized by a steep increase in velocity errors below a limiting range of '60 m. To improve the quality of the velocity data by increasing the instrument range, modern LADCP systems often include both upward- and downward-looking ADCPs. The data analyzed here indicate that the addition of a second ADCP can be as effective as doubling the range of a single-head LADCP system. However, in one of the datasets the errors associated with the profiles calculated from combined up- and down-looker data are significantly larger than the corresponding errors associated with the profiles calculated from the down-looker alone. The analyses carried out here indicate that the velocity errors associated with LADCP profiles can be significantly smaller than expected from previously published results and from the uncertainty estimates calculated by the velocity inversion method.},

  abstract = {Data collected with acoustic Doppler current profilers installed on CTD rosettes and lowered through the water column [lowered ADCP (LADCP) systems] are routinely used to derive full-depth profiles of ocean velocity. In addition to the uncertainties arising from random noise in the along-beam velocity measurements, LADCP-derived velocities are commonly contaminated by bias errors due to imperfectly measured instrument attitude (heading, pitch, and roll). Of particular concern are the heading measurements, because it is not usually feasible to calibrate the internal ADCP compasses with the instruments installed on a CTD rosette, away from the magnetic disturbances of the ship. Heading data from dual-headed LADCP systems, which consist of upward- and downward-pointing ADCPs installed on the same rosette, commonly indicate heading-dependent compass errors with amplitudes exceeding 108. In an attempt to reduce LADCP velocity errors, several dozen profiles of simultaneous LADCP and magnetometer/accelerometer data were collected in the Gulf of Mexico. Agreement between the LADCP profiles and simultaneous shipboard velocity measurements improves significantly when the former are processed with external attitude measurements. Another set of LADCP profiles with external attitude data was collected in a region of the Arctic Ocean where the horizontal geomagnetic field is too weak for the ADCP compasses to work reliably. Good agreement between shipboard velocity measurements and Arctic LADCP profiles collected at magnetic dip angles exceeding 878 and processed with external attitude measurements indicate that high-quality velocity profiles can be obtained close to the magnetic poles.},

The first is the conventional approach of using climate models as a means for developing understanding of the climate system variations and for projections of the future. Climate models have improved enormously, but even with the biggest supercomputers, models cannot resolve scales needed to depict many important phenomena. Major challenges remain in addressing chaotic natural weather and climate variability, and processing huge volumes of data. The second is an approach based upon understanding the changing Earth's energy imbalance (EEI) and tracking the consequences through the flows of energy through the climate system. A new assessment is given of the EEI through estimates of the uptake of heat by glaciers and ice sheets, land, and the oceans, and implications for the hydrological cycle. The oceans take up 93\% of EEI of 0.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 W m-2 (or 430 TW). Climate change is already readily apparent, with major consequences and costs.},

TOA measurements of radiation from space can track changes over time but lack absolute accuracy. An inventory of energy storage changes shows that over 90\% of the imbalance is manifested as a rise in ocean heat content (OHC). Data from the Ocean Reanalysis System, version 4 (ORAS4), and other OHC-estimated rates of change are used to compare with model-based estimates of TOA energy imbalance [from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4)] and with TOA satellite measurements for the year 2000 onward. Most ocean-only OHC analyses extend to only 700-m depth, have large discrepancies among the rates of change of OHC, and do not resolve interannual variability adequately to capture ENSO and volcanic eruption effects, all aspects that are improved with assimilation of multivariate data. ORAS4 rates of change of OHC quantitatively agree with the radiative forcing estimates of impacts of the three major volcanic eruptions since 1960 (Mt. Agung, 1963; El Chich\'on, 1982; and Mt. Pinatubo, 1991). The natural variability of the energy imbalance is substantial from month to month, associated with cloud and weather variations, and interannually mainly associated with ENSO, while the sun affects 15\% of the climate change signal on decadal time scales. All estimates (OHC and TOA) show that over the past decade the energy imbalance ranges between about 0.5 and 1 W m-2. By using the full-depth ocean, there is a better overall accounting for energy, but discrepancies remain at interannual time scales between OHC- and TOA-based estimates, notably in 2008/09.},

A change in the overall energy balance will thus sooner or later have consequences for the climate. Existing observing systems can measure all the required quantities, but it nevertheless remains a challenge to obtain closure of the energy budget.

  abstract = {Motivated by the substantial sensitivity of eddies in two-layer quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence models to the strength of bottom drag, this study explores the sensitivity of eddies in more realistic ocean general circulation model (OGCM) simulations to bottom drag strength. The OGCM results are interpreted using previous results from horizontally homogeneous, two-layer, flat-bottom, f-plane, doubly periodic QG turbulence simulations and new results from two-layer, b-plane QG turbulence simulations run in a basin geometry with both flat and rough bottoms. Baroclinicity in all of the simulations varies greatly with drag strength, with weak drag corresponding to more barotropic flow and strong drag corresponding to more baroclinic flow. The sensitivity of the baroclinicity in the QG basin simulations to bottom drag is considerably reduced, however, when rough topography is used in lieu of a flat bottom. Rough topography reduces the sensitivity of the eddy kinetic energy amplitude and horizontal length scales in the QG basin simulations to bottom drag to an even greater degree. The OGCM simulation behavior is qualitatively similar to that in the QG rough-bottom basin simulations, in that baroclinicity is more sensitive to bottom drag strength than are eddy amplitudes or horizontal length scales. Rough topography therefore appears to mediate the sensitivity of eddies in models to the strength of bottom drag. The sensitivity of eddies to parameterized topographic internal lee wave drag, which has recently been introduced into some OGCMs, is also briefly discussed. Wave drag acts like a strong bottom drag in that it increases the baroclinicity of the flow, without strongly affecting eddy horizontal length scales.},

The analysis focuses on testing 1) a simplified turbulent kinetic energy equation, in which production balances dissipation; 2) the Prandtl\textendash Karman law of the wall, which is a relationship between bottom stress and near-bottom velocity gradient; and 3) a simplified depth-integrated along-channel momentum balance involving local acceleration, pressure gradient, and bottom stress. Estimates of production and dissipation agree well throughout the entire record. The relationship between bottom stress and velocity gradient is consistent with the law of the wall within approximately 1 m of the seafloor during flooding tides, but it departs from the law of the wall at greater heights during flooding tides and at all resolved heights during ebbing tides. The local stratification is too small to explain this effect, and the likely explanation is suppression of the turbulent length scale by the finite thickness of the relatively well-mixed layer beneath the pycnocline. Direct covariance estimates of bottom stress close the approximate momentum balance well during some periods, but are often smaller than the sum of the other terms in the balance by a factor of roughly up to 2. The agreement between stress estimates and the sum of the other terms is best during periods of strongest top-to-bottom stratification and worst during periods of weak stratification, for reasons that are not understood.},

Vertical diffusivity estimated from observations, 0.1 ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1 for the upper layer and 3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1 for the bottom layer, is adopted. Comparison is made between cases with different vertical diffusivity at middepths. With larger vertical diffusivity at middepths, the deep Pacific circulation becomes stronger. This is due to enhanced heat exchange between the thermocline water and the deep water through more intense diffusion at middepths. The water below the thermocline is warmed and that at the thermocline is cooled for the whole basin. The warmed deep water leads to larger heat loss through the sea surface, causing the enhanced deep-water formation in the deep-water formation region. On the other hand, the cooled thermocline water leads to larger heat gain through the sea surface where the thermocline water outcrops, counterbalancing the larger heat loss in the deepwater formation region. The deep water brought up to the middepths does not further upwell to the sea surface due to the small upper-layer vertical diffusivity, but it flows back to the deep-water formation region, slowly upwelling within the middepths. In this way, the enhanced meridional overturning forms in the deep Pacific. The layered deep Pacific meridional circulation is realistically reproduced when vertical diffusivity is larger at middepths. This circulation yields tracer distributions that compare well with observations. Such a strong deep Pacific circulation does not occur when vertical diffusivity is taken larger at middepths but is held constant below the middepths. For realistic reproduction of the deep Pacific circulation, vertical diffusivity needs to keep increasing with depth beginning at the lower thermocline depths.},

The data processing, however, is still in a rather primitive state. First, a method to estimate bottom-track velocities using the standard water profile data was developed. Then inverse solutions are presented that enhance the standard data processing by adding external constraints such as bottom-referenced velocity profiles. Depending on the depth of the profile and the ADCP range the inclusion of bottom-track data can reduce the local velocity errors by a significant factor. The least squares framework also allows for simplified error analysis of the LADCP system and some of the trade-offs are discussed.},

Analysis of the control simulations of the two models shows that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the North Atlantic climate have some differences, which may be related to the representation of overflow processes. Firstly, in CM2G, as in the real world, overflows have two branches flowing out of the Nordic Seas, to the east and west of Iceland, respectively, while only the western branch is present in CM2M. This difference in overflow location results in different horizontal circulation in the North Atlantic. Secondly, the diapycnal mixing in the overflow downstream region is much larger in CM2M than in CM2G, which affects the entrainment and product water properties. Two sensitivity experiments are conducted in CM2G to isolate the effect of these two model differences: in the first experiment, the outlet of the eastern branch of the overflow is blocked, and the North Atlantic horizontal circulation is modified due to the absence of the eastern branch of the overflow, although the AMOC has little change; in the second experiment, the diapycnal mixing downstream of the overflow is enhanced, resulting in changes in the structure and magnitude of the AMOC.},

  abstract = {The Kerguelen Plateau is a major topographic feature in the Southern Ocean. Located in the Indian sector and spanning nearly 2000 km in the meridional direction from the polar to the subantarctic region, it deflects the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and influences the physical circulation and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean. The Kerguelen Plateau is known to govern the local dynamics, but its impact on the large-scale ocean circulation has not been explored. By comparing global ocean numerical simulations with and without the Kerguelen Plateau, this study identifies two major Kerguelen Plateau effects: 1) The plateau supports a local pressure field that pushes the Antarctic Circumpolar Current northward. This process reduces the warm-water transport from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean. 2) The plateau-generated pressure field shields the Weddell Gyre from the influence of the warmer subantarctic and subtropical waters. The first effect influences the strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Agulhas leakage, both of which are important elements in the global thermohaline circulation. The second effect results in a zonally asymmetric response of the subpolar gyres to Southern Hemisphere wind forcing.},

  abstract = {To evaluate uncertainty in the transient climate response (TCR) associated with microscale deep-ocean mixing processes induced by internal tidal wave breaking, a set of idealized climate model experiments with two different implementations of deep-ocean mixing is conducted under increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration 1\% per year. The difference in TCR between the two experiments is 0.16 \textdegree C, which is about half as large as the multimodel spread of TCR in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The TCR difference can be attributed to the difference in the preindustrial climatological state. In the case where deep-ocean mixing works to enhance ocean stratification in the Pacific intermediate-to-deep layers, because the Pacific water mass is transported to the Southern Ocean by the Pacific meridional overturning circulation, the subsurface stratification in the Southern Ocean is also enhanced and deep wintertime convection there is suppressed. Our study shows that in this case during CO2 increase, ocean heat uptake from the atmosphere to deeper layers is suppressed and TCR is estimated to be higher than the other case. Diminished accumulation of oceanic heat in the deep layer also leads to the sea level depression of {$\sim$}0.4 m in the Southern Ocean when atmospheric CO2 concentration has quadrupled. Together with convective and cloud-radiative processes in the atmosphere and oceanic mesoscale processes, microscale deep-ocean mixing can be one of the major candidates in explaining uncertainty in future climate projections.},

The character of inertial motions has been described more fully bs\textbullet{} recent observations with moored current meters. Inertial motions have a transient nature, with generation and decay times of a few days. An analysisof the data from a single simple experiment shows that the inertial motions are coherent horizontally over much greater scales than they are coherent vertically.

The intensity of the stratification between the layers influences the internal mixing dynamics and entrainment, facilitating the transport of dissolved constituents within the fluid medium. Acoustic systems offer the means for high resolution observations of these interfaces, which allow for continuous data collection over broad spatial scales. Here, a one-dimensional acoustic scattering model is presented for predicting acoustic backscatter from stratification interfaces, which is widely applicable to the acoustic water column data collected with ship-mounted sonars. Model predictions based on hydrographic profiles suggest that in many oceanic cases, the density gradient perturbations can be disregarded, and sound speed perturbations alone drive the majority of the acoustic scattering. A frequency-dependent scattering intensity based on the sharpness of the stratification interface is predicted by the model, suggesting a path to remote estimations of the physical medium properties through broadband acoustic inversion.},

The instability results from the release of available potential energy, which can be generated because of the observed bottom intensification of turbulent mixing in the deep ocean, or the Ekman adjustment of a current on a slope. Linear stability analysis suggests that the growth rates of bottom boundary layer baroclinic instabilities can be comparable to those of the surface mixed layer mode and are relatively insensitive to topographic slope angle, implying the instability is robust and potentially active in many areas of the global oceans. The solutions of two separate onedimensional theories of the bottom boundary layer are both demonstrated to be linearly unstable to baroclinic instability, and results from an example nonlinear simulation are shown. Implications of these findings for understanding bottom boundary layer dynamics and processes are discussed.},

This study evaluates finescale estimates derived from isopycnal strain by comparing them with average microstructure profiles from six diverse environments including the equator, above ridges, near seamounts, and in strong currents. The finescale strain estimates are derived from at least 10 nearby Argo profiles (generally \textexclamdown 60 km distant) with no temporal restrictions, including measurements separated by seasons or decades. The absence of temporal limits is reasonable in these cases, since the authors find the dissipation rate is steady over seasonal time scales at the latitudes being considered (0\,\textdegree?30\,\textdegree and 40\,\textdegree?50\,\textdegree ). In contrast, a seasonal cycle of a factor of 2?5 in the upper 1000 m is found under storm tracks (30\,\textdegree?40\,\textdegree ) in both hemispheres. Agreement between the mean dissipation rate calculated using Argo profiles and mean from microstructure profiles is within a factor of 2?3 for 96 \% of the comparisons. This is both congruous with the physical scaling underlying the finescale parameterization and indicates that the method is effective for estimating the regional mean dissipation rates in the open ocean.},

  abstract = {Calculation was made of the northward flow of Antarctic Bottom Water into the western North Atlantic Basin through a passageway approximately 300 km wide between the Ceara Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at about 4\textdegree N. Two moorings carrying four current meters each were placed in the region where currents were expected to be the greatest and were left for 360 days. The current was not steady, but exhibited large surges with approximately a 60-day time scale whose cause is unknown. Current meters in the fastest flowing region all exhibited a net northward flow. It is estimated that approximately 0.8\texttimes 106 m3 s-1 of water colder than 1.9\textdegree C (potential temperature) flowed on the average into the North Atlantic, with this number possibly being too small by 0.3\texttimes 106 m3 s-1 or too big by 0.1\texttimes 106 m3 s-1 depending upon estimates of the width of the region, which the current meters sample. However, these numbers differ from geostrophic estimates of 1.98\texttimes 106 m3 s-1, the disagreement coming almost entirely from the fact that the geostrophic estimates give a sizeable flux of water colder than 1.2\textdegree C while the current meters do not. Based upon the two different flux rates, residence times and mixing coefficients are calculated for Antarctic Bottom Water for each 0.1\textdegree C potential temperature interval from 1.0\textdegree C to 1.9\textdegree C. Finally, some comments on the dynamics of the northward flow are made.},

  abstract = {The behaviour of a gravity current propagating into a two-layer stratified ambient fluid is described in detail. A comprehensive description is given of the different flow regimes, with particular emphasis on the front condition linking the thickness of the gravity current to its speed of propagation and the transfer of energy to upstream disturbances in the form of internal bores and nonlinear solitary waves. Hydraulic theory analogous to that of two-layer flow over topography (Baines, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 146, 1984, pp. 127\textendash 167) is extended to the gravity current problem to classify frontal behaviour into the following regimes: Type I, subcritical currents; Type II, currents that generate upstream undular bores; Type III, currents that generate an upstream monotonic bore connected by a rarefaction; Type IV, supercritical fronts with a large-amplitude trapped solitary-wave-like disturbance; and Type V, supercritical gravity currents. Over 200 two-dimensional Boussinesq\textendash Euler simulations spanning a range of gravity current properties demonstrate good agreement, for both the behavioural regime and the front condition Uo(h), with hydraulic theory that extends original work by Rottman \& Simpson (Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., vol. 115, 1989, pp. 941\textendash 963) to arbitrary ambient layer thickness, and uses an improved closure for the upstream bore that correctly predicts the behaviour in the limit of large bore amplitude. In addition, the energy balance is analysed, and it is shown that the energy transfer from the gravity current to upstream disturbances is significant, and consistent with the hydraulic theory. The results demonstrate a clear connection to the problem of upstream resonance in two-layer flow over topography, and have significant implications for interpreting field observations of nonlinear internal waves generated by atmospheric density currents and coastal river plumes.},

Three different models of increasing complexity are used: a simple, analytically tractable zonally averaged model; a coarse-resolution numerical model with parameterized eddies; and an eddy-resolving general circulation model. Two elements are found to be necessary for the existence of an adiabatic pole-to-pole cell: 1) a thermally indirect, wind-driven overturning circulation in the zonally reentrant channel, analogous to the Deacon cell in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region, and 2) a set of outcropping isopycnals shared between the channel and the semienclosed region of the Northern Hemisphere. These points are supported by several computations varying the domain geometry, the surface buoyancy distribution, and the wind forcing. All three models give results that are qualitatively very similar, indicating that the two requirements above are general and robust.             The zonally averaged model parameterizes the streamfunction associated with adiabatic buoyancy fluxes as downgradient diffusion of buoyancy thickness, with a diffusivity in the semienclosed region of the Northern Hemisphere much larger than that in the ACC region. In the simple model, the disparity in diffusivities is necessary to obtain a substantial pole-to-pole ROC. The simple model also illustrates how the geometry of the isopycnals is shaped by the interhemispheric ROC, leading to three major thermostads, which the authors identify with the major water masses of the Atlantic: that is, North Atlantic Deep Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, and Antarctic Bottom Water.},

Acoustic thermometry provides an alternative and complementary remote sensing methodology for monitoring fine temperature variations of the deep ocean over long distances between a few underwater sources and receivers. We demonstrate a simpler, totally passive (i.e., without deploying any active sources) modality for acoustic thermometry of the deep oceans (for depths of 500\textendash 1500 m), using only ambient noise recorded by two existing hydroacoustic stations of the International Monitoring System. We suggest that passive acoustic thermometry could improve global monitoring of deep-ocean temperature variations through implementation using a global network of hydrophone arrays.},

Wave action conservation suggests that a substantial fraction of lee-wave radiation can be reabsorbed into bottom-intensified flows. Numerical simulations are conducted here to investigate generation, reabsorption, and dissipation of internal lee waves in a bottom-intensified, laterally confined jet that resembles a localized abyssal current over bottom topography. For the case of monochromatic topography with |               kU               0               | {$\approx$} 0.9               N               , where               k               is the along-stream topographic wavenumber, |               U               0               | is the near-bottom flow speed, and               N               is the buoyancy frequency; Reynolds-decomposed energy conservation is consistent with linear wave action conservation predictions that only 14\% of lee-wave generation is dissipated, with the bulk of lee-wave energy flux reabsorbed by the bottom-intensified flow. Thus, water column reabsorption needs to be taken into account as a possible mechanism for reducing the lee-wave dissipative sink for balanced circulation.},

With the goal of identifying the processes that transfer momentum and energy between the larger-scale and smaller-scale flows, detailed tidally-resolving shipboard surveys were conducted near a sharp and steep headland north of Velasco Reef, Palau, in the Western Pacific. We present velocity, microstructure and rapid-cycling conductivity and temperature measurements, contextualized with a nearby 10-month moored record, to examine wake and vortex structures. Observed flow near Velasco Reef was layered and multi-directional in depth such that the ``downstream'' side of the headland depended on depth. Downstream of the headland, during a period where mean flow dominated over the tide in the top 100 m of the water column, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude relative to those upstream. During a period dominated by tides, the flow reversed periodically and wake eddies were associated with turbulent dissipation rates up to . Turbulent dissipation rates in the wake increased with inverse Richardson number for both tidal and mean flows past the headland, and were larger for stronger vorticity flows. Our analysis suggests that the eddies themselves lead to shear instabilities and subsequent turbulence, either through tilting or their limited vertical extent. We associate the enhanced downstream dissipation with a combination of breaking internal tides and either these eddy processes or a multi-scaled turbulent wake.},

Using in-situ data collected near the BBL at an abyssal seamount in the western Pacific Ocean, we demonstrate that strong bottom-trapped flows over sloping topography can lose their energy to near-inertial waves (NIWs) generated via the adjustment of the bottom Ekman layer. The NIWs with near-resonant frequencies corresponding to internal waves with propagation direction parallel to the topographic slope are observed. These waves are strongest in the BBL and have a correlation with the off-seamount sub-inertial flows largely attributed to the Ekman transport driven by the bottom-trapped anticyclonic circulation over the seamount. The bottom-intensified NIWs are observed to have dominant upward propagating energy and hypothesized to be generated via Ekman flow-topography interactions in the BBL. Energy loss from the near-bottom flows to radiating NIWs (\textasciitilde 8 \texttimes{} 10-4 W/m2) is estimated to be substantially larger than that due to bottom drag dissipation (\textasciitilde 2 \texttimes{} 10-4 W/m2), suggesting the important role of internal wave generation via the Ekman transport adjustment in damping the sub-inertial flows over the sloping seafloor.},

  abstract = {Wind-driven geostrophic currents have been considered as one of the major energy sources for stimulating abyssal mixing that shapes the ocean overturning circulation. However, the mechanism governing the energy transfer from surface geostrophic currents to small dissipation scales available for abyssal mixing remains elusive. In this study, we identify a potential energy transfer pathway from surface geostrophic eddies to abyssal small-scale turbulence based on observations and numerical simulations of flows over seamounts in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Our analyses reveal the generation of strong near-bottom anticyclonic circulations following the passage of surface geostrophic eddies across seamounts. These circulations drive downslope Ekman transports and convective instabilities, leading to enhanced turbulent mixing and thickened bottom mixed layers. Altimetry observations suggest that the energy transfer from surface eddies to deep currents and subsequent turbulence may be a dominant mechanism that accounts for 25\textendash 40\% energy decay of mesoscale eddies passing seamounts. Strong near-bottom anticyclonic circulations associated with the surface geostrophic eddies are likely common for many seamounts and other topographic slopes in the global ocean, and may therefore play a significant role in the oceanic energy balance and water mass transformation in the abyssal ocean.},

  abstract = {To address the lack of directly measured turbulence data in the Kuril Straits, an existing method was modified to indirectly estimate continuous vertical profiles of turbulent energy dissipation rate e by using density inversions. A linear relationship was confirmed between directly measured e and indirectly estimated e from the existing method, where most of the detected density inversions were discarded as noise. The existing method thus yielded large gaps in the vertical profiles, and the gaps were much greater than the observed mean autocorrelation vertical length scale of about 10 m. To reduce these gaps and produce reasonable estimates for vertical e profiles, the quality tests were carefully re-examined with directly measured e data, and one of the quality tests (the water mass test) was excluded because the test rejects real density inversions even with large e. With this modification, and interpolation and smoothing of the indirectly estimated e with the mean correlation length scale, continuous vertical e profiles were obtained. These profiles have an error factor of 3.3 corresponding to one standard deviation of the ratio between directly observed and estimated data, and 95 \% of the data were within a factor of 10.5, with the overall correlation coefficient between smoothed directly measured e and estimated e equal to 0.80. This method could be useful for areas where 10-9 \textbackslash{} e \textbackslash{} 10-6.5 W/kg, and where vertical distances between adjacent density inversions are mostly less than the mean autocorrelation scale.},

The year-long observations show that near-inertial motions are mainly generated by local wind forcing, and that they radiate equatorward and downward following several strong wind events (wind stress {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.5 N m-2). Observational estimates of horizontal group speed typically exceed those of vertical group speed by two orders of magnitude, consistent with predictions from the dispersion relation. Enhanced near-inertial kinetic energy and vertical shear are found only in mesoscale anticyclones with Rossby number of O(0.1). By contrast, submesoscale motions with order one Rossby number have little effect on the trapping and vertical penetration of NIWs, due to their smaller horizontal scales, shorter time scales, and confined vertical extent compared to mesoscale eddies.},

During an 1820-yr-long integration of the model, polynyas are forced every 29 years in the Weddell Sea via an increase in the diapycnal diffusivity. Composites of the events are used to examine the mechanisms responsible for transporting polynya signals away from the Weddell Sea. Polynya signal transport is governed by two dynamical mechanisms that act on different time scales and spread at different rates. Large-scale waves, such as Kelvin and planetary and topographic Rossby waves, propagate the polynya signal rapidly, on interannual-to-decadal time scales, while advection transports the signal more slowly, on decadal-to-centennial time scales. Despite their different spreading rates, these mechanisms can act contemporaneously, and it is often their combined effect that governs the property changes in the global deep and abyssal oceans. Both waves and advection cause temperature changes on isobaths. In the deep Atlantic, advection accounts for {$<$}15\% of the total temperature change in the model, indicating that waves are strongly dominant there. Elsewhere, waves are still the stronger contributor, but advection accounts for 20\%\textendash 40\% of the total temperature change.},

From 2003 to 2007 two current meter moorings were present on each side of the Vema Sill, close to the narrowest spot of the Vema Channel. The data from the moorings are compared with earlier current and temperature observations. On average the maximum current core lies {$\sim$}100m above the bottom of the sill with a mean northward speed of 0.3ms-1. Farther up in the water column where Lower Circumpolar Deep Water and North Atlantic Deep Water prevail, one finds a level of sluggish currents with a southward tendency in the sub-centimeter-per-second range. The lower boundary of a layer of `no' motion was observed at {$\sim$}3700m depth where the mean potential temperature amounts to 1.5\textdegree C. The evolution of the abyssal warming phenomenon over the last decades with notable fluctuations at the choke point between the Argentine and the Brazil Basin differs from the more stable attitude of deep horizontal currents. Starting with CTD observations in 1972 we find a steady increase of temperatures of the coldest AABW in the Vema Channel. This general trend of rising abyssal potential temperatures of almost 2mKelvin per year is based on mostly annual CTD observations. The overall warming trend is fully compatible with our three-year moored temperature series in agreement with earlier records with high temporal resolution. Distinct frequently fluctuating horizontal current shear between the western and eastern sides of the Vema Sill may be explained by two different catchment areas for AABW at the mouth of the Vema Channel. One pathway originates at the American continental rise and advects bottom water in form of the deep western boundary current. A second pathway is supplied by an eastern boundary current along the Mid Atlantic Ridge in the Argentine Basin. Both source waters merge at the channel entrance, mix, and their respective strengths can alternate within the sill area.},

  abstract = {Analysis of data from the Levitus (1982) atlas shows that the application of the Montgomery streamfunction to the potential density surfaces induces an error which cannot be ignored in some regions in the ocean. The error arises from the variation of the specific volume anomaly along isopycnal surfaces. By including the major part of this effect, new streamfunctions, named the "pressure anomaly" and "mean pressure" streamfunctions, are suggested for use in potential density coordinates. By including the variations of specific volume anomaly and pressure along isopycnal surfaces, the inverse model proposed by Hogg (1987) is modified for increased accuracy and then applied to the Brazil Basin to study the circulation, diffusion and water mass balances. The system of equations with constraints of positive diffusivities and oxygen consumption rates is solved by the inverse method. By using multiple tracers and controlling the scale of variation of the diffusion coefficients we are able to construct an overdetermined system whose solution is by a least-square approach. The results indicate that the circulation in the upper ocean is consistent with previous work, but that in the deep ocean differs from some previous analyses. In the NADW depth, we find a coincidence of flow with tongues of water properties. The diffusivities and diapycnal velocities seem stronger in the region near the equator than in the south, with reasonable values. Diffusion plays an important role in the water property balances. Examples show that similar property patterns may result from different processes.},

It is extracted in two steps: First, the mode-2 component is separated from modes 1 and 3 by a bandpass filter with cutoff wavelengths of [0.85 1.35]\texttimes{$\lambda$}2, where {$\lambda$}2 is the mode-2 wavelength; and second, three mode-2 internal tidal waves are extracted by fitting plane waves in each 120 km by 120 km window. The satellite-observed mode-2 M2 internal tide underestimates its strength: It contains the phase-locked component only, missing the time-varying component; it contains the southbound/northbound component only, missing the eastbound/westbound component. The satellite results provide rich information on the global mode-2 M2 internal tide. The results show that the mode-2 M2 internal tide is ubiquitous in the ocean, and its sea surface height amplitudes are O (1 mm). The spatial patterns of mode-1 and mode-2 internal tides are very different. Mode 1 mainly originates at steep topographic features such as submarine ridges, but mode 2 is also generated at gentler topographic features such as abyssal seamounts and fracture zones. Mode-1 beams propagate O (1,000 km), while mode-2 beams can be tracked for O (100 km). Depth-integrated energy and flux are calculated using sea surface height amplitudes and conversion functions built from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. The globally integrated energy of the mode-2 M2 internal tide approximates to 8 PJ, about 22\% of mode 1 (36.4 PJ). This work suggests that higher-mode internal tides play an important role in the tidal energetics, in particular, over abyssal seamounts and fracture zones.},

We have assessed the potential for measuring fine-scale ocean velocities from the Wirewalker platform using commercially available acoustic velocimeters. Although the vertical profiling speed is relatively steady, platform motion affects the velocity measurements and requires correction. We present an algorithm to correct our velocity estimates using platform motion calculated from the inertial sensors\textemdash accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer\textemdash on a Nortek Signature1000 acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). This correction, carried out ping by ping, was effective in removing the vehicle motion from the measured velocities. The motion-corrected velocities contain contributions from surface wave orbital velocities, especially near the surface, and the background currents. To proceed, we use an averaging approach that leverages both the vertical platform profiling of the system and the {$\sim$}15\textendash 20 m vertical profiling range resolution of the down-looking ADCP to separate the surface wave orbital velocities and the background flow. The former can provide information on the wave conditions. From the latter, we are able to estimate fine-scale velocity and shear with spectral wavenumber rolloff at vertical scales around 3 m, a vertical resolution several times finer than that possible from modern shipboard or fixed ADCPs with similar profiling range, and similar to recent glider measurements. When combined with a continuous time series of buoy drift calculated from the onboard GPS, a highly resolved total velocity field is obtained, with a unique combination of space and time resolution.},

  abstract = {Observations of absolute velocity based on Argo float profiles and trajectories in the ocean interior show evidence for an equatorward current, the East Pacific Rise current, between 42{$\circ$}S and 30{$\circ$}S, along the western flank of the East Pacific Rise. The East Pacific Rise current carries predominantly intermediate water masses, including Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water, and deeper waters, from the southern edge of the subtropical gyre toward the Equator. The 2004 to 2014 mean East Pacific Rise current transport extrapolated through the 0\textendash 2600 m depth range is 8.1 {$\pm$} 1.6 sverdrup (Sv) (1 Sv = 106 m3 s-1), consistent with a wind-driven interior transport influenced by the East Pacific Rise topography. While deep ocean mixing and geothermal heating can both create pressure gradients that support geostrophic flows in the deep ocean, this study indicates that about half of the East Pacific Rise current transport is associated with topographic steering of the deep flow over the East Pacific Rise.},

  abstract = {Upper-ocean turbulence is central to the exchanges of heat, momentum, and gases across the air\textendash sea interface and therefore plays a large role in weather and climate. Current understanding of upper-ocean mixing is lacking, often leading models to misrepresent mixed layer depths and sea surface temperature. In part, progress has been limited by the difficulty of measuring turbulence from fixed moorings that can simultaneously measure surface fluxes and upper-ocean stratification over long time periods. Here we introduce a direct wavenumber method for measuring turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rates   from long-enduring moorings using pulse-coherent ADCPs. We discuss optimal programming of the ADCPs, a robust mechanical design for use on a mooring to maximize data return, and data processing techniques including phase-ambiguity unwrapping, spectral analysis, and a correction for instrument response. The method was used in the Salinity Processes Upper-Ocean Regional Study (SPURS) to collect two year-long datasets. We find that the mooring-derived TKE dissipation rates compare favorably to estimates made nearby from a microstructure shear probe mounted to a glider during its two separate 2-week missions for O(1028) \#   \# O(1025) m2 s23. Periods of disagreement between turbulence estimates from the two platforms coincide with differences in vertical temperature profiles, which may indicate that barrier layers can substantially modulate upper-ocean turbulence over horizontal scales of 1\textendash 10 km. We also find that dissipation estimates from two different moorings at 12.5 and at 7 m are in agreement with the surface buoyancy flux during periods of strong nighttime convection, consistent with classic boundary layer theory.},

  abstract = {We present 15 days of both mean and turbulent field observations bottom mixing-layer at a gently sloping 250 m deep continental shelf site, energized by tides and nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs). The tidal frequency forcing was due to the combined effects of the barotropic tide and a mode-1 internal tide (IT), while the NLIWs were predominantly mode-1 waves of depression. The bottom mixing-layer thickness varied at both semidiurnal and sub-tidal similar to O(10)d frequencies, with an average thickness of around 10 m. Compression and expansion of the mixing-layer by both the IT and NLIWs affected the mean velocity profiles in the mixing-layer, while the phasing between the barotropic and baroclinic flows led to an asymmetry in mean velocity profiles between periods of rising and falling isotherms. With the exception of periods of flow reversal, the turbulent kinetic energy balance and turbulent stress observations were consistent with the existence of an inertial-sublayer with thickness of approximately 10\%-15\% of the mixing-layer thickness ( similar to 1 m), even beneath NLIWs. In the outer portion of the mixing-layer-that is, above the inertial-sublayer-NLIWs modulated the local turbulence spectra. We discuss the observations in the context of a predictive model for mixing-layer thickness. The analysis suggests that the high-frequency variability in mixing-layer thickness was dominated by internal wave pumping, though strength of the ambient stratification and the frequency of the forcing were important controls on the time-averaged (sub-tidal) variation.},
