This paper examines detailed observations and a semi-idealized 2D (non-hydrostatic) model of a density-driven overflow. The observations are impressive (i.e., they include non-trivial estimates of TKE dissipation and vertical velocities) and the authors have carefully though about how to construct energy and momentum budgets given the strengths and limitations of the observations. The modeling results do not match the observations precisely, but provide a welcomed sanity check. The paper quantifies many useful terms in the energy and momentum budgets, which will allow quantitative comparisons with future observations, numerical simulations, and parameterizations. The analyses here have significant caveats and uncertainties, but all of these issues are well documented. The manuscript is well written and references the relevant literature. Many/most references are discussed in detail and linked to the central methods and results of the study (as opposed to a less-helpful pro-forma list of references in the introduction). This work will of be of interest the readers of JPO and I recommend the paper be published with minimal edits.

Fig. 9 Change the color bar on the 3rd and 4th row to match other fluxes? The purple color makes it look like the fluxes are going to the left, when compared with the rows below them.
